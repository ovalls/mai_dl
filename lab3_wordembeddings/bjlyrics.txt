**Runaway
On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes
All your life, all your life all you've asked when's your daddy gonna talk to you
But you were living in another world tryin' to get your message through.
No one heard a single word you said.
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head.
Ooh, she's a little runaway.
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say.
Ooh, she's a little runaway.
A different line every night guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets, calling for a wild time
So you sit home alone 'cause there's nothing left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you
You know she likes the lights at night on the neon Broadway signs
She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find
Ooh, she's a little runaway.
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say.
Ooh, she's a little runaway.
No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head.
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
Now she works the night away
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
Now she works the night away
**Roulette
Bet the black comes in red, crimes of passion rule my head
I need you, you want him, dressed to kill we live in sin
I know the game you play, I know it well
You just keep on playin' when all the bets are down
Roulette you're goin' round in a spin
Caught up in a game you can't win
Roulette, you're just a fantasy
It's everything that you want it to be
Play the numbers one by one, fire the shot and the damage is done
Restless lovers pay the price, cheating hearts don't think twice
When you make the rules no one can slow you down
You just keep 'em waiting when you're on the prowl
Roulette you're goin' round in a spin
Caught up in a game you can't win
Roulette, you're just a fantasy
It's everything that you want it to be
Roulette you're goin' round in a spin
Caught up in a game you can't win
Roulette, you're just a fantasy
It's everything that you want it to be
Backdoor runner got away this time
Leaves her mark at the scene of the crime
Nothing matters, no faces, no names
You're just a number, it's all the same
You just love to play the game
I know the game you play, I know it well
You just keep on playin' when all the bets are down
Roulette you're goin' round in a spin
Caught up in a game you can't win
Roulette, you're just a fantasy
It's everything that you want it to be
Roulette you're goin' round in a spin
Caught up in a game you can't win
Roulette, you're just a fantasy
It's everything that you want it to be
**She Don't Know Me
What more can I do, there's nothing I haven't tried 
Still it's so hard for her to notice 
I've tried hard to be straight 
There's nothing left I can say 
If only she would look my way 
[Chorus:]
She don't know me, she don't know 
She don't see me, she don't care 
She can't hear me, can't hear 
Can not help me, she don't want 
She don't want me like I want her 
Like I wan't her got to tell her 
Got to tell her that I love her 
That I love her 
She doesn't even know my name 
I dream of when she'll be mine 
I dream of crossing that line 
And holding her so tender 
Dreaming it could come true 
So many things I would do 
If only you'd give me a chance 
**Shot Through The Heart
Shot through the heart.
It's all part of the game that we call love.
Would you be content to see me crying
After all those little games you put me through?
After all I've done for you, you're lying.
Wouldn't it be nice to tell the truth?
Didn't somebody somewhere say
You're gonna take a fall?
I gave you everything.
Now here's the curtain call.
And I'm shot through the heart
As I lay there alone
In the dark.
Through the heart.
It's all part of the game that we call love.
Now you've come back here to say you're sorry.
I just don't know who you're talking to.
It could be the man I used to be, girl.
I've grown up, and now I'm over you.
Standing there, just a live wire
With nowhere left to turn.
You were gonna set the world on fire,
But you'll never learn
That you're shot through the heart
As I lay there alone in the dark.
Through the heart.
It's all part of the game that we call love.
Standing there just a live wire
With nowhere left to turn.
You were gonna set the world on fire,
But you'll never learn.
Now, you're shot.
Baby does what baby please.
Baby must have what she sees.
But not this time: the tables turned,
And baby just got burned.
Shot through the heart
As I lay there alone in the dark.
Through the heart.
It's all part of the game that we call—
Shot through the heart
As I lay there alone in the dark.
Through the heart.
It's all part of the game that we call—
Shot through the heart (shot)
As I lay there alone in the dark (shot).
Through the heart (shot).
Shot. [7x]
**Love Lies
I was lost, then I found you 
Never thought it would be this way 
I showed you my heart, left it unguarded 
Like a thief in the night you stole it away 
Now you're gone, the pain goes on and on 
I still hear you whispering to me through the shadows of the night 
[Chorus:]
Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines 
You're running on into a cold night 
You're just a number of the love lies 
All alone you call it survival 
He lost at love to a stranger's lines 
Walking the streets, searching with vengeance 
For a face that he dreams of night after night 
Time goes on, all signs of life stolen, simple dreams were all broken 
Best of times become desperation but how many tears must you cry to survive 
[Chorus]
They met late one night in the city 
Both men knew only one would stay 
Scratched a picture of a heart on a bullet 
And took his life away 
[Chorus]
**Breakout
This time girl I've had enough 
You're too hot to handle with kid gloves 
It's too late I hear a knock on the door 
The game's over baby I can't take it no more 
[Chorus:]
Breakout, Breakout 
Take these chains from me 
You held my heart for ransom 
Baby, set it free 
Breakout, Breakout 
Your lies can't hide what I see 
I'm better off on my own 
Promises made me in the heat of the night (Whoa-oh-oh) 
Those words were broken under bedroom lights (Whoa-oh) 
Your lips they burn your body calls my name (Whoa-oh) 
I can feel the fire but it's all in vain (Whoa-oh) 
[Chorus]
You say we'll meet around midnight 
You're gonna make me feel oh so right 
I'm saying oh no not tonight 
You gotta let me go 
[Chorus]
You say we'll meet around midnight 
You're gonna make me feel oh so right 
I'm saying oh no not tonight 
You gotta let me go
**Burning For Love
I've been lied to, you been cheated 
I've been cried to, you been mistreated 
I've been watching you, you want action 
You need love and I need satisfaction 
[Chorus:]
I'm burning for love 
Filled with desire 
I can't stand the heat 
And my heart's on fire 
I can't get enough 
It's down to the wire 
I'm making my move, I'm looking for you 
I'm burning for love 
You're the victim it's in your eyes 
I'm the suspect and love's the crime 
Tensions mounting bodies shaking 
I can't take the anticipation 
[Chorus]
Now that I got you in my sight 
Can't take another sleepless night 
Oh, no, no 
You can run but you can't hide 
You're the only one I need 
To feel the fire inside 
[Chorus]
**Come Back
Now that you're gone, I can see what 
Was going on and how you lied 
When you'd said you'd never love again 
Friends telephone and they say 
You weren't out alone last night 
Can't you see that this broken heart 
Is killing me 
Another night is falling 
And now my heart is calling you back to me 
[Chorus:]
Come back cause I need your love 
Come back got to have your love 
Come back bring your loving back to me 
Come back cause it's been so long 
Come back, and my love's still strong 
Come back bring your loving back to me 
You play with words play with love 
It's just your silly way 
I'm a fool cause I need you by my side again 
Now it's too late you walk by 
With another man 
And I stand alone 
Cause I know that you're not coming home 
Another night is falling 
And now my heart is calling you back to me 
[Chorus]
Another night is falling 
And now my heart is calling you back to me 
[Chorus]
**Get Ready
You need someone to make it last 
No Romeos who'll love and leave you fast 
They fade away 
Tonight you're not gonna be alone 
Making love on the telephone 
Baby, baby if you can hold on 
I'm gonna take you all the way tonight 
I like 'em down and dirty, so hold on tight 
[Chorus:]
Come on get ready 
Come on get ready 
You're looking sharp in your dancing shoes 
You got the style and you got the moves 
Oh you're so hot, girl and on the loose 
You're caught up in a danger zone 
Just seventeen but you act full grown 
The night life, baby, is turning you on 
You want to take me all the way tonight 
Take my hand, you can feel the heat 
Make you feel alright 
[Chorus]
Come on 
Come on
**In And Out Of Love
In and out of love [6x]
Young and wired
Set to explode in the heat
You won't tire
'Cause, baby, was born with the beat
Take you higher than you've ever known
Then drive you down to your knees
I'll pick you up when you've had enough
You been burned, baby, lessons learned
In and out of love
Hear what I'm sayin'
In and out of love
It's the way that we're playing
In and out of love
Too much is never enough
She's gonna get ya
Running wild
When me and my boys hit the streets
Right on time
She's here to make my night complete
Then I'm long gone, I got another show
One more town, one mile to go
One endless night of fantasy
Is all she left of her with me
In and out of love
Hear what I'm sayin'
In and out of love
It's the way that we're playing
In and out of love
Too much is never enough
She's gonna get ya
Out of love [4x]
In and out of love [12x]
**The Price Of Love
One heart one other 
They met last summer 
One move she started 
Now they love this way 
The pain of pleasure 
Lying together 
You're at their mercy 
As the telephone' ringing on 
No one said there'd be nights like this 
Risk your life for a stolen kiss 
[Chorus:]
We live, we learn, we lie 
For the price of love 
We kiss then say goodbye 
For the price of love 
We live, we learn, we lie 
For the price of love 
We kiss then say goodbye 
For the price of love 
Each move goes so slow 
Until the doors close 
No secret codes now 
No words as baby goes down 
One last dance then goodbye 
Practicing his love lies 
He runs to his wife 
And your left holding the knife 
You live your life to take that chance 
When your a master of the art of romance 
And you know you won't cross that line 
Until that last slow dance 
[Chorus]
Alone our lonely hearts would die. 
It's all in the game 
And the way that it's played 
There's no time to wonder why 
To catch you when you fall 
Answer when you call 
No one can hear you cry 
[Chorus]
**Only Lonely
Another long and sleepless night 
You need someone to hold you tight 
Sometimes love don't know wrong from right 
Another long and senseless 
Fight was all you knew they're all the same 
There's no one left to take the blame 
What's behind this masquerade 
How do we win these losin' 
Games we play, words we say 
Cutting wounds we know they run so deep 
Leave it all behind you 
Or someday love will find you 
[Chorus:]
Only lonely -- I can't stop hurting you 
Only lonely -- but I can't stop loving you 
Only lonely -- how much pain does it take 
It's getting sometimes I don't know 
When to stop when to go 
Sometimes we're so afraid to let it show 
A stolen kiss so out of place 
It wipes the smile right off your face 
And when those feelings start 
We let them go, let them go 
Games we play, words we say 
Cutting wounds that run so deep 
Leave it all behind you 
Or someday love will find you 
Only lonely -- I can't stop hurting you 
Only lonely -- but I can't stop loving you 
Only lonely -- so tell me babe, how much pain 
can you take before your heart breaks? 
I got this timebomb ticking in my head 
This time I think she's gonna blow 
How can I say get away 
When I just can't let go 
Games we play, words we say 
Cutting wounds that run so... 
Leave it all behind you 
Or someday love will find you 
[Chorus]
**King Of The Mountain
Listen people can't you hear the voices that are crying out 
There's a hunger burning in the heart of their souls 
Maybe now that I got you let me tell you what I'm talking 'bout 
Stand up and shout tonight we'll lose control 
I been down and mistreated 
Now we're standing undefeated 
[Chrous:]
I'm the King of the Mountain 
I'm the King of the Hill 
I'm the King of the Mountain 
I'm the King of the Hill 
You spend your life working 9 to 5 it's like doing time 
Boss man says "Hey boy, you'll never be no good" 
With the night there's a magic in the air that makes us come alive 
Tonight's the night they can't put you down, no one could 
I been down and mistreated 
Now we're standing undefeated 
[Chorus]
Listen people can't you hear the voices that are crying out. 
There's a hunger burning in the heart of their souls. 
Maybe now that I got you let me tell you what I'm talking 'bout 
Stand up and shout tonight we'll lose control 
I been down and mistreated 
We won't be cheated 
Now we're standing undefeated... 
[Chorus]
**Silent Night
After the smoke clears 
When it's down to you and I 
When the sun appears 
And there's nothing left but goodbyes 
We'll just turn and walk away 
How could we let it end like this 
Just turn and walk away 
Should we seal it with a kiss 
It's too late 
Now you're out and on the run 
It's too late 
Held up in love without a gun 
[Chorus]
Silent night 
We hold up our candle light 
Silent night 
The night our love died 
No words to say 
And we're both too tired to fight 
Just hold me close and don't let go... 
It was all so simple when 
You were to be queen and I'd be your king 
I guess those dreams got lost 
Cause baby you're still you and I'm still me 
Now letting go 
It's always the hardest part to fight 
When we both know 
We're just two more victims of the night 
It's too late 
Too late to wonder why 
Much too late 
To save a love that's died. 
[Chorus]
Just hold me close and don't let me go 
After the smoke cleared 
It was down to you and I 
When the sun appeared 
There was nothing left but goodbyes... 
Silent night
**Tokio Road
In a time, in a place 
In a world, they forgot 
Lives the heart of me 
A part that just won't die 
Just a boy, not a man 
Sent to war, in a land 
They said we'd fight for their freedom 
But I felt like a hired hand 
Sometimes I have to find my way 
Sometimes I have to get away 
[Chorus]
Take me back to Tokyo Road 
Take me back to Tokyo Road 
Working hard, for a pass 
Got the night, make it last 
It was a time to remember 
All my life I would never forget 
In a bar, breathing smoke 
Snorting whiskey, drinking coke 
It was a time when no one would die 
And there wasn't a care 
Sometimes I wish it was that way 
Cause sometimes I have to get away 
[Chorus]
This guy turns me around and he's pointing up the stairs 
I found myself in her doorway but there wasn't anybody there 
She walked in the room with nothing on but a red light 
And with a smile she got so close to me. 
She whispered something 'bout midnight 
You know I didn't understand a word she said 
But it felt so good 
She knew that I didn't have any money 
But baby I knew she would... 
[Chorus]
**The Hardest Part Is The Night
In the heat of the street of the city 
A young boy hides the pain 
And he walks so tall, trying to hang on 
But he knows he's going down again 
I know he's going down... 
Darkness fades he's the prince of his city 
In a place where they all know your name 
You can see in their eyes life so paralyzed. 
Your just a pawn in a losin' game 
You lose at life it ain't no game 
[Chorus:]
Hear their cries 
The hardest part is the night 
(In the night, hear their cries, in the night) 
Stay alive 
The hardest part is the night, it's the night, it's the night... 
All alone in a place where the lonely 
They all have to walk through the rain 
And they dance on the edge where you only 
Only pray that it has to end 
That the night ain't no friend 
[Chorus]
These four walls they could tell you some stories 
About lying and dying and fame 
There's a price that you pay for the glory 
About losing and choosing and pain. 
[Chorus]
**Always Run To You
The clock strikes ten 
Out on the streets again 
I been looking for something to please me since I don't know when 
Out on the dark side of town 
Another rumble's gone down 
And life on the high side isn't what this boys about 
She's got something I want man, it's something I need 
It takes more than the night to satisfy me... 
[Chorus:]
I stand accused 
I can always run to you 
Any road that you choose 
I can always run to you 
I stand accused 
I can always run to you 
I run to you 
Baby, I can always run 
To a heart of chrome 
And a soul of steel 
We've done more white lines than you'll know any one we could steal 
And when I give her the gun 
You know she feels so right 
And we don't let go when we're alone when I'm holding her so tight 
She's got something I want man, it's something I need 
It takes more than the night to satisfy me 
[Chorus]
And when the morning comes and I go to sleep 
When I close my eyes she's waiting for me 
I know that tonight she'll satisfy me 
[Chorus]
**(I Don't Wanna Fall) To The Fire
We would take no prisoners 
'Cause there was nobody giving in 
They came walking through my jungle 
And met an angel about to sin 
I heard a voice from inside of me 
When the youth of America cried: 
Can you help me, hear me call 
[Chorus:]
I don't wanna fall (I don't wanna fall) 
I don't wanna fall (I don't wanna fall) 
To the fire 
I don't wanna fall (I don't wanna fall) 
I don't wanna fall (I don't wanna fall) 
To the fire 
When you're a part of society 
You know, the heart of your innocence dies 
When we met with Authority 
I looked him right between the eyes 
'Cause all we had was our innocence 
All we had was our hearts to try to win the fight you tell me... 
Can you save me, from it all 
[Chorus]
Can you help me, hear me call 
Can you save me, from it all 
[Chorus]
**Secret Dreams
Riding high, then shot down 
I load my guns to fire another round 
I look deep into your eyes 
And can't run there's nowhere left to hide 
Don't stop, no it's much too late 
When the night comes I can't wait 
Oh I live, love to loose control 
It makes me crazy I want to let you know 
[Chorus:]
Oh, no, I don't want to fall 
Oh, oh, can't you hear me calling 
All night long in my secret dreams 
You tell me I'm the one 
When I'm next to you -- next to you. 
All I want in my secret dreams 
Is you here with me. 
I got to get to you, get to you, get to you. 
There's a thrill, in the chase 
We won't lose when we meet face to lace. 
Love, games a means without and end. 
I go down but I'll be back again 
Thru' the night with no retreat 
When you're with me in my sleep. 
[Chorus]
I can see you 
I feel you every night 
I need you 
But I'm only dreaming 
All night long in my secret dreams 
You tell me I'm the one 
When I'm next to you -- next to you. 
All I want in my secret dreams 
Is you here with me.
**Let It Rock
The weekend comes to this town 
Seven days too soon 
For the ones who have to make up 
What we break up of their rules 
Well I saw Captain Kidd on Sunset 
Tell his boys they're in command 
While Chino danced a tango 
With a broomstick in his hand 
He said: It's alright (alright) if you have a good time 
It's alright (alright) if you want to cross that line 
To break on through to the other side 
[Chorus:]
Let it rock, let it go 
You can't stop a fire burning out of control 
Let it rock, let it go 
With the night you're on the loose 
You got to let it rock 
We go down to the Broadway 
Where everybody goes 
To get on their rockin' horse 
And blast that radio 
Well I saw Roxie on the table 
Her girlfriend down below 
They'll give it to the king of swing 
Before it's time to go 
They said: It's alright (alright) if you have a good time 
It's alright (alright) if you want to cross that line 
To break on through to the other side 
[Chorus]
**You Give Love A Bad Name
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
Darling, you give love a bad name
An angel's smile is what you sell
You promise me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free
Oh, oh, you're a loaded gun
Oh, oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name (bad name)
I play my part
And you play your game
You give love a bad name (bad name)
You give love a bad name
You give love a bad name
Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye
Oh, oh, you're a loaded gun
Oh, oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name (bad name)
I play my part
And you play your game
You give love a bad name (bad name)
You give love
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part
And you play your game
You give love a bad name (bad name)
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name (bad name)
I play my part
And you play your game
You give love a bad name (bad name)
You give love
You give love (bad name)
You give love
You give love (bad name)
You give love
You give love (bad name)
You give love
You give love (bad name)
**Livin' On A Prayer
Once upon a time not so long ago
Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck
It's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man
She brings home her pay
For love, for love
She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love we'll give it a shot."
Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it. I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in
What he used to make it talk
So tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay, someday
We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love we'll give it a shot
Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it. I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer
We've gotta hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got
Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
**Social Disease
You can read it in the papers 
In some places it comes in thirty-two flavors 
But you wouldn't tell no one 
Your favorite if you could 
From the White House to the alleys 
From the President down to Long Tall Sally 
Can't live with it but 
You'll die without it - yes you would 
Senorita's in the kitchen 
She's a fistful of dynamite 
You call 911 but you 
Can't stop the fun tonite, it's alright 
[Chorus:]
You can't start a fire without a spark 
But there's something that I guarantee 
You can't hide when infection starts 
Because love is a social disease 
Where you look you can find it 
Try to run but you're always behind it 
So you play hide and seek like a blind kid 
Till you're caught - yeah you're caught 
So you'll say that you had some 
But they took it and held it for ransom 
Were they tall, dark, skinny or 
Handsome - you won't talk 
So you telephone your doctor 
Just to see what pill to take 
You know there's no prescription 
Gonna wipe this one away 
[Chorus]
So full of high grade octane 
She could run the bullet train on 38 double d's 
Now you know for sure, you know the cure 
To make a blind man see
**Wanted Dead Or Alive
It's all the same, only the names will change
Every day it seems we're wasting away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home
I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
And the people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day
By the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone all you do is think
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted, wanted, dead or alive
Wanted (wanted) dead or alive
Alive
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive
And I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back
I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back
I've been everywhere, and still I'm standing tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all
'Cause I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
'Cause I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my side
I'm wanted dead or alive
And I ride dead or alive
I still drive, dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
**Raise Your Hands
You - you got a nasty reputation 
We're in a sticky situation - it's down to me and you 
So tell me - is it true ... they say there ain't nobody better 
Well now that we're together 
Show me what you can do 
You're under the gun 
Out on the run 
Gonna set the night on fire 
You're out on the run 
Under the gun 
And playin' to win 
[Chorus:]
Raise your hands
When you want to let it go
Raise your hands 
And you want to let a feeling show 
Raise your hands 
From New York to Chicago 
Raise your hands 
From New Jersey to Tokyo 
Raise your hands 
I - I've been out on the front line 
Where you'll go down if you waste time 
They'll walk all over you 
But I - I ain't here looking for surrender 
I'll raise the flag if you'll defend her 
It's up to you 
You're under the gun 
Out on the run 
Gonna set the night on fire 
You're out on the run 
Under the gun 
And playin' to win 
[Chorus]
**Without Love
She wasn't young, but still a child 
There still was innocence 
In painted smiles 
She called to me as I passed her by 
Lady of the night looked in my eyes 
She said: I been through some changes 
But one thing always stays the same 
[Chorus:]
Without love, there's nothing without love 
Nothing else can get through the night 
Nothing else feels right without love 
I saw a man down on lonely street 
A broken man who looked like me 
And no one knows the pain that he's been living 
He lost his love and still hasn't forgiven 
He said: I've been through some changes 
But one thing always stays the same 
[Chorus]
There's nothing without love 
Nothing else but love can burn as bright 
And nothing would mean nothing without love 
I see my life 
There's some things I took for granted 
Love's passed me by 
So many second chances 
I was afraid 
But I won't be afraid no more 
[Chorus]
There's nothing without love 
Nothing else but love can burn as bright 
And nothing would mean nothing without love
**I'd Die For You
If you could see inside my heart
Then you would understand
I'd never mean to hurt you
Baby I'm not that kind of man
I might not say I'm sorry
Yeah, I might talk tough sometimes
And I might forget the little things
Or keep you hanging on the line
In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet
Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets
Into the fire we cry
[Chorus:]
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
I'd do anything
I'd lie for you
You know it's true
Baby I'd die for you
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
If it came right down to me and you
You know it's true, Baby I'd die for you
I might not be a savior
And I'll never be a king
I might not send you roses
Or buy you diamond rings
But if I could see inside you
Maybe I'd know just who we are
'Cause our love is like a hunger
Without it we would starve
In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet
Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets
Into the fire we cry
[Chorus]
**Never Say Goodbye
As I sit in this smokey room
The night about to end
I pass my time with strangers
But this bottle's my only friend
Remember when we used to park
Out on Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys
And you lost more than that in my backseat baby
Remember how we used to talk
About busting out
We'd break their hearts
Together forever
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Holdin' on we gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
Remember days of skipping school
Racing cars and being cool
With a six pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go
Remember at the prom that night
You and me we had a fight
But the band they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong
We danced so close
We danced so slow
And I swore I'd never let you go
Together forever
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Holdin' on we gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
I guess you'd say we used to talk
About busting out
We'd break their hearts
Together forever
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Holdin' on we gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
**Wild In The Streets
Joey comes from a sacred part of town 
Where sometimes you talk so tough 
That your feet don't touch the ground 
And the sidewalk soldiers sing the midnite blues 
While the old men recite their story lines 
About when I was young like you 
They say: Oh yeah 
We were cruising to the backbeat 
Oh yeah, Making love in the backseats 
We were wild, wild in the streets 
A member of the boy's brigade 
Had a date with the girl next door 
You know it made her daddy crazy 
But it only made her want him more 
They weren't looking for trouble 
You know that boy didn't want a fight - not tonight 
So she headed out thru her bathroom window 
What her daddy didn't know was gonna be alright 
They said: Oh yeah 
We were cruising to the backbeat 
Oh yeah, Making love in the backseats 
We were wild, wild in the streets 
Wild, wild in the streets 
Wild, wild in the streets 
Wild, wild in the streets 
Sometimes this town ain't pretty 
But you know it ain't so bad 
Just like a girl who looks so happy 
Whe inside she's so so sad 
In here we got this code of honor 
Nobody's going down 
You don't walk in vain 
Trough the kid's parade 
'Cause this is my hometown
**Lay Your Hands On Me
If you're ready, I'm willing and able 
Help me lay my cards out on the table 
You're mine and I'm yours for the taking 
Right now the rules we made are meant for breaking 
What you get ain't always what you see 
But satisfaction's guaranteed 
They say what you give is always what you need 
So if you want me to lay my hands on you 
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, 
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, 
Lay your hands on me 
I'm a fighter, I'm a poet, I'm a preacher 
I've been to school and baby, I've been the teacher 
If you show me how to get up off the ground 
I can show you how to fly and never ever come back down 
Everything you want is what I need 
Satisfaction's guaranteed 
But the ride don't never ever come for free 
If you want me to lay my hands on you 
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, 
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, 
Lay your hands on me 
[Solo] 
Don't you know I only aim to please 
If you want me to lay my hands on you 
Lay your hands on me
**Bad Medicine
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad medicine)
I ain't got a fever got a permanent disease
It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms count 'em 1, 2, 3
First you need
That's what you get for falling in love
Then you bleed
You get a little but it's never enough
And then you're on your knees
That's what you get for falling in love

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
Bad, bad medicine
I don't need no needle to be giving me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction that doesn't leave a track
I got a jones for your affection like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack
When you need
That's what you get for falling in love
Then you bleed
You get a little but it's never enough
And then you're on your knees
That's what you get for falling in love
Now this boy's addicted 'cause your kiss is the drug
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need

So let's play doctor, baby, cure my disease
Bad, bad medicine
Is what I want
Bad, bad medicine

[Solo]
I need a respirator 'cause I'm running out of breath
For you're an all night generator wrapped in stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine you take what you can get
'Cause if there's something better baby well they haven't found it yet
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
Your love—bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need

(Bad, bad medicine)
I gotta do, I gotta
I gotta, I gotta
I gotta do it again
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Hold on
I'm not done
One more time with feel
Come on
One for that
Help me up now
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
You got the potion that can cure my disease
Your love—bad medicine
Your kiss is what I need
Your love—bad medicine
**Born To Be My Baby
Rainy night and we worked all day 
We both got jobs 'cause there's bills to pay 
We got something they can't take away 
Our love, our lives 
Close the door, leave the cold outside 
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side 
We got something that'll never die 
Our dreams, our pride 
My heart beats like a drum (all night) 
Flesh to flesh, one to one (and it's alright) 
And I'll never let go cause 
There's something I know deep inside 
You were born to be my baby 
And baby, I was made to be your man 
We got something to believe in 
Even if we don't know where we stand 
Only God would know the reasons 
But I bet he must have had a plan 
Cause you were born to be my baby 
And baby, I was made to be your man 
Light a candle, blow the world away 
Table for two on a TV tray 
It ain't fancy, baby that's OK 
Our time, our way 
So hold me close better hang on tight 
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride 
We're two kids hitching down the road of life 
Our world, our fight
If we stand side by side (all night) 
There's a chance we'll get by (and it's alright) 
And I'll know that you'll be live 
In my heart till the day that I die 
Cause you were born to be my baby 
And baby, I was made to be your man 
We got something to believe in 
Even if we don't know where we stand 
Only God would know the reasons 
But I bet he must have had a plan 
Cause you were born to be my baby 
And baby, I was made to be your man 
[Solo]
My heart beats like a drum (all night) 
Flesh to flesh, one to one (and it's alright) 
And I'll never let go cause 
There's something I know deep inside 
Cause you were born to be my baby 
And baby, I was made to be your man 
We got something to believe in 
Even if we don't know where we stand 
Only God would know the reasons 
But I bet he must have had a plan 
Cause you were born to be my baby 
And baby, I was made to be your man 
You were born to be my baby 
And baby, I was made to be your man
**Living In Sin
I don't need no license
To sign on no line
And I don't need no preacher
To tell me you're mine
I don't need no diamonds
I don't need no new bride
I just need you, baby
To look me in the eye
I know they have a hard time
And your Daddy don't approve
But I don't need your Daddy
Telling us what we should do
Now there's a million questions
I could ask about our lives
But I only need one answer
To get me through the night
So, I say
Baby, can you tell me just where we fit in
I call it love they call it living in sin
Is it you and me or just this world we live in
I say we're living on love they say we're living in sin
Is it right for both our parents
Who fight it out most nights
Then pray for God's forgiveness
When they both turn out the lights
Or wear that ring of diamonds
When your heart is made of stone
You can talk but still say nothing
You stay together but alone
Or is it right to hold you
And kiss your lips goodnight
They say the promise is forever
If you sign it on the dotted line
Baby, can you tell me just where we fit in
I call it love they call it living in sin
Is it you and me or just this world we live in
I say we're living on love they say we're living in sin
[Solo]
Baby, can you tell me just where we fit in
I call it love they call it living in sin
Is it you and me or just this world we live in
I say we're living on love they say we're living in sin
I call it love they call it living in sin
Living in sin
I don't know where to begin
I don't know where we fit in
Living in sin
**Blood On Blood
I can still remember 
When I was just a kid 
When friends were friends forever 
And what you said was what you did 
Well, it was me and Danny and Bobby 
We cut each other's hands 
And held tight to a promise 
Only brothers understand 
But we were so young (so young) 
One for all and all for one (for one) 
Just as sure as the river's gonna run 
Blood on blood 
One on one 
We'd still be standing 
When all was said and done 
Blood on blood 
One on one 
And I'll be here for you 
Till Kingdom come 
Blood on blood 
Well, Bobby was our hero 
Cause he had a fake I.D. 
I got busted stealing cigarettes 
And he took the rap for me 
Danny knew this white trash girl 
We each threw in a ten 
She took us to this cheap motel 
And turned us into men 
We were so young (so young) 
One for all and all for one (for one) 
Just as sure as the river's gonna run 
Blood on blood 
One on one 
We'd still be standing 
When all is said and done 
Blood on blood 
One on one 
And I'll be here for you 
Till Kingdom come 
Blood on blood 
[Solo]
Now Bobby, he's an uptown lawyer 
Danny, he's a medicin man 
And me, I'm just the singer 
In a long haired rock'n'roll band 
Through the years and miles between us 
It's been a long and lonely ride 
But if I got a call in the dead of the night 
I'd be right by your side 
Blood on blood, blood on blood 
Blood on blood 
One on one 
We'd still be standing 
When all is said and done 
Blood on blood 
One on one 
And I'll be here for you 
Till Kingdom come 
Blood on blood 
Blood on blood
**Homebound Train
When I was just a boy 
The devil took my hand 
Took me from my home 
He made me a man 
So, don't talk to me about sympathy now 
Cause you can't dance if you 
Take a chance on your rosary 
I'm going down, down, down, down, down 
On the homebound train 
It's been a millions years 
That I been gone 
I been everywhere, now I'm heading home 
Been a lot of girls, but 
There's a woman I know 
Said don't take no plane 
Better take a train 
Cause I like it real slow 
All the way back home 
On the homebound train 
I'm going down, down, down, down, down 
On the homebound train 
[Solo]
I'm on my way 
I'm heading home 
To be with my baby 
Where I belong 
Coming down the tracks now 
See, I done my time 
I'm going back now 
To that home of mine 
Well, here I come baby 
Here I come baby 
Here I come baby 
All the way back home 
On that homebound train 
I'm going down, down, down, down, down 
On that homebound train
**Wild Is The Wind
I tried to make you happy 
You know I tried so hard to be 
What you hoped that I would be 
I gave you what wanted 
God couldn't give you what you need 
You wanted more from me 
Than I could ever be 
You wanted heart and soul 
But you didn't know, baby 
Wild, wild is the wind 
That takes me away from you 
Cold is the night without your love 
To see me through 
Wild, wild is the wind 
That blows through my heart 
Wild is the wind, 
Wild is the wind 
You got to understand, baby 
Wild is the wind 
You need someone to hold you 
Somebody to be there night and day 
Someone to kiss your fears away 
I just went on pretending 
Too weak, too proud, too tough to say 
I couldn't be the one 
To make your dreams come true 
That's why I had to run 
Though I needed you, baby 
Wild, wild is the wind 
That takes me away from you 
Cold is the night without your love 
To see me through, baby 
Wild, wild is the wind 
That blows through my heart tonight 
That tears us apart 
Wild is the wind, 
Wild is the wind 
You got to understand, baby 
Wild is the wind 
[Solo]
Maybe a better man 
Would live and die for you 
Baby, a better man would 
Never say goodbye to you 
Wild, wild is the wind 
That takes me away from you 
Cold is the night without your love 
To see me through, baby 
Wild, wild is the wind 
That blows through my heart tonight 
That tears us apart 
Wild is the wind, 
Wild is the wind 
You got to understand, baby 
Wild is the wind
**Ride Cowboy Ride
Ride cowboy ride. 
Through the back door to heaven. 
To the other side. 
I wanna know the danger of a kiss. 
At midnight. 
Ride, cowboy, ride. 
Yeah, I learn my lesson. 
Here's a story to tell
So I made my confession. 
In this sleazy motel. 
I could be the romantic
I could try my best lines
But ain't got the money
And we ain't got the time. 
Ride, cowboy, ride. 
Through the back door to heaven to the other side. 
I wanna know the danger of a kiss. 
At midnight. Ride cowboy ride. 
So you want to be a cowboy. 
Ride cowboy, ride. 
You want to be a big shot.
Baby, come on. 
Ride, ride, ride.
**Stick To Your Guns
So you want to be a cowboy
Well you know it's more than just a ride
Guess you got to know the real thing
If you want to know the other side
Ain't nobody riding shotgun
In this world tonight
And when you spit, you better mean it
You got to make 'em all believe it
If you're gonna be the one
Stick to your gun
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you, baby
You can go for the trigger
But only if you have to
Aim from the heart
Some will love and some will curse you, baby
And you can go to war
But only if you have to
It's only if you have to
So you want to be the big time
Some people have to drag you down
There's no living in the backseat
If you're gonna drive through town
And when you pray for independence
Boy, you better stand your ground
You got to give it all you got now
Or you might get shot down
Fight hard until the battle is won
Stick to your gun
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you, baby
You can go for the trigger
But only if you have to
Aim from the heart
Some will love and some will course you, baby
And you can go to war
But only if you have to
But only if you have to
[Solo]
Well, you know that I been through it
I got the scars to prove it
Fight hard and the Battle is yours
Stick to your gun
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you, baby
You can go for the trigger
But only if you have to
Aim from the heart
Some will love and some will course you, baby
And you can go to war
But only if you have to
It's only if you have to
But stick to your guns
**I'll Be There For You
I guess this time you're really leaving
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well, as my broken heart lies bleeding
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimming for the shore
You left me drowning in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
Now I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance, girl
I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you
I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hiding place
Well, I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday
And, baby, you know my hands are dirty
But I wanted to be your Valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine
I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you
I wasn't there when you were happy
And I wasn't there when you were down
I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out
I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for
I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what a love can do
I'll be there for you
**99 In The Shade
I feel I'm burning up with fever 
But the fire's feeling really good tonight 
And it's alright 
I'm gonna see Sahara Jack and Suntan Sally 
Somebody tells me even Tommy's coming down tonight 
If Gina says it's alright 
I'm gonna see those Senoritas 
Lying under the sun 
They're greasing it up 
With know I want to be their blanket 
Gonna tell every girl 
Hey, baby... You're the one... 
Oh tell the boys I'm on my way 
I got the radio blasting in my old man's Chevrolet 
I got a party in my pocket cause you know I just got paid 
And I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade 
I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade 
When the sun goes down that's when the street heats up 
Senorita Margarita fills your empty cup tonight - 
She make you feel alright 
A good time here don't cost much money 
Just a little sweet talking and a pretty native honey 
And you're set for life 
Or one hell of a nigth 
I'm gonna see those sons of beaches 
Out there living it up the surf 
And the sand, 
Man that life ain't so tough 
So get me in the action so I can tell 
Every girl she's the one 
Oh tell the boys I'm on my way 
I got the radio blasting in my old man's Chevrolet 
I got a party in my pocket cause you know I just got paid 
And I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade 
I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade
**Love For Sale
Well I wake up this morning I rolled out of bed 
I felt like a dog who's been kicked in the head 
Checked out my mail there was letter that read 
Love for sale, love for sale 
I picked up the phone I called everyone I could 
I let my fingers do the walking through the telephone book 
You can't catch a fish if you ain't got the hook 
Love for sale, love for sale 
Send up a signal throw me a line 
Somebody explain " this funny Valentine" 
It might not be legal but it sure ain't a crime 
I'm one step from crazy and two steps behind 
I called Lt. Columbo from my TV set 
I've tried the Dating Game I haven't found her yet 
I'm hoping that she's looking like a Penthouse Pet 
Love for sale, love for sale 
[Solo]
We've been living together 3 years, 
2 hours, 20 minutes maybe four houndred beers 
You can't shop for love when you're shopping at, Sears 
Love for sale, love for sale 
I guess I've learnt my lesson it was easy to see 
My old lady she played this joke on me 
I never looked where I forgot it would be 
Love for sale, love for sale
**I Believe
All I know is what I've been sold 
You can read my life like a fortune told 
I've seen the dream, there's no land of Oz 
But I got my brain and I got a heart 
And courage built I won't let go 
What we need right now is ....soul 
I can't do this, you can't do that 
They feed us lines but I won't act 
And all good things will come to pass 
But the truth is all you have to have 
And would you lie for it? 
(Do you) cry for it? 
(Would you) die for it? 
Would you 
I believe, I believe 
With every breath that I breathe 
You and me can turn a whisper to a scream 
I believe, I believe 
You know what you came here for 
You'll pay the cost, 
like it's your cross to bear 
Are we the ones that put it there 
Would you scheme for it 
scream for it, bleed for it 
Would you 
I believe, I believe 
Believe we're still worth 
The fight you'll see 
There's no hope for this world tonight 
I believe, I believe 
Don't look up on your movie screens 
In record stores or magazines 
Close your eyes and you will see 
That you are all you really need 
I believe, I believe 
With every breath that I breathe 
You and me can turn a 
whisper to a scream 
I believe, I believe
**Keep The Faith
Mother, mother, tell your children
That their time has just begun
I have suffered for my anger
There are wars that can't be won
Father, father, please believe me
I am laying down my guns
I am broken like an arrow
Forgive me
Forgive your wayward son
Everybody needs somebody to love
(mother, mother)
Everybody needs somebody to hate
(please believe me)
Everybody's bitching
'Cause they can't get enough
And it's hard to hold on
When there's no one to lean on
Faith: you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith
Faith: don't you let your love turn to hate
Right now we've gotta
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Lord we've gotta keep the faith
Tell me baby when I hurt you
Do you keep it all inside
Do you tell me all's forgiven
Just hide behind your pride
Everybody needs somebody to love
(mother, father)
Everybody needs somebody to hate
(please don't leave me)
Everybody's bleeding
'Cause the times are tough
Well it's hard to be strong
When there's no one to dream on
Faith: you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord we've gotta keep the faith
Faith!
Don't you know it's never too late
Right now we've gotta keep the faith
Faith: don't you let your love turn to hate
Lord we've gotta keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Oh, we've gotta keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Lord we've gotta keep the faith
I've been walking in the footsteps
Of society's lies
I don't like what I see no more
Sometimes I wish that I was blind
Sometimes I wait forever
To stand out in the rain
So no one sees me cryin'
Trying to wash away this pain
Mother father
(Everybody needs somebody to love)
There's things I've done I can't erase
(Everybody needs somebody to hate)
Every night we fall from grace
(Everybody's bitching 'cause they can't get enough)
It's hard with the world in your face
(Everybody bleeds)
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on
(Everybody, keep the pain)
Faith: you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord we've gotta keep the faith
Faith: don't you let your love turn to hate
Right now we've gotta keep the faith
Faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on
Faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
(Everybody, keep the pain)
Faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Faith
(Everybody needs somebody to love)
(Everybody needs somebody to hate)
(Everybody needs somebody to love)
(Everybody bleeds)
(Everybody, keep the pain)
Faith
Faith
**I'll Sleep When I'm Dead
Seven days of saturday 
Is all that I need 
Got no use for Sunday 
'Cause I don't rest in peace 
Don't need no Mondays 
Or the rest of the week 
I spend a lot of time in bed 
But baby I don't like to sleep no 
I won't lie to you 
I'm never gonna cry to you 
I'll probably drive you wild 8 days a week 
Until I'm 6 feet under 
Baby I don't need a bed 
Gonna live while I'm alive 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 
Till they roll me over 
And lay my bones to rest 
Gonna live while I'm alive 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 
So you're looking for some action 
I got got everything you need 
Better keep your motor running 
'cause I was built for speed 
This ain't no slumber party 
Got no time for catching z's 
If they say that that ain't healthy 
Well then living's a disease 
We're never going to die baby 
Come on let me drive you crazy 
We'll make every night another New Year's Eve 
Till I'm six feet under 
I won't need a bed 
Gonna live while I'm alive 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 
Till they roll me over 
And lay my bones to rest 
Gonna live while I'm alive 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 
Sleep when I'm dead, sleep when I'm dead 
Gonna live while I'm alive, 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 
Seven days of Saturday 
Is all that I need 
Got no use for Sunday 
'Cause I don't rest in peace 
I was born to live 
You know I wasn't born to die 
But if they party down in heaven 
I'll be sure to be on time 
Until I'm six feet under 
I don't need a bed 
Gonna live while I'm alive 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 
Till they roll me over 
And lay my bones to rest 
Gonna live while I'm alive 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 
I feel like I'm exploding 
Going out of my head 
Gonna live while I'm alive 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 
Till I'm six feet under 
And they lay my bones to rest 
Gonna live while I'm alive 
I'll sleep when I'm dead 
Sleep when I'm dead, sleep when I'm dead 
Gonna live while I'm alive, sleep when I'm dead
**In These Arms
You want commitment
Take a look into these eyes
They burn with fire
Until the end of time
And I would do anything
I'd beg, I'd steal, I'd die
To have you in these arms tonight
Baby, I want you
Like the roses want the rain
You know I need you
Like a poet needs the pain
And I would give anything
My blood, my love, my life
If you were in these arms tonight
I'd hold you
I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd love you
I'd please you
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you 'til the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight
We stared at the sun
And we made a promise
A promise this world
Would never blind us
And these were our words
Our words were our songs
Our songs are our prayers
These prayers keep me strong
And I still believe
If you were in these arms
I'd hold you
I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd love you
I'd please you
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you 'til the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight
Your clothes are still scattered all over our room
This whole place still smells like your cheap perfume
Everything here reminds me of you
And there's nothing I wouldn't do
And these were our words
They keep me strong, baby
I'd hold you
I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd love you
I'd please you
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you 'til the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight
If you were in these arms tonight
If you were in these arms tonight
If you were in these arms, baby
Like the roses need the rain
Like the seasons need to change
Like a poet needs the pain
I need you in these arms tonight
**Bed Of Roses
Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano,
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of vodka's still lodged in my head,
And some blonde gave me nightmares.
I think that she's still in my bed.
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead.
With an ironclad fist I wake up and French-kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe:
About love, the truth, what you mean to me.
And the truth is,
Baby, you're all that I need.
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses,
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails.
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is,
And lay you down on a bed of roses.
Well, I'm so far away.
Each step that I take is on my way home.
A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night to see through this pay-phone.
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through.
'Til the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper,
"Baby, blind love is true."
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses,
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails.
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is,
And lay you down on a bed of roses.
Well, this hotel bar's hangover whiskey's gone dry.
The barkeeper's wig's crooked and she's giving me the eye.
Well, I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died.
Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you.
While my mistress—she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again.
Tonight I won't be alone,
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely.
I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend.
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses,
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails.
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is,
And lay you down.
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses,
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails.
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is,
And lay you down on a bed of roses.
**If I Was Your Mother
If I was your mother 
Would you let me hold your hand 
Would you say you were my baby 
Would you always be my friend 
If I was your mother 
Could I teach you what's right 
Could I tell you stories 
Maybe tuck you in 
And kiss you sweet goodnight 
Tell me what I got to do 
To make my life mean more to you 
I could get so close it's true 
If I was your mother 
Would you always believe me 
'Cause I'd wake up in the middle 
Of the night 
Just to see if you need me 
Tell me there's no mother 
To who you're telling your secrets 
And would you tell me 
'Bout all the boys you been 
Bringing home to meet me 
Tell me what I got to do 
To make my life mean more to you 
I could get so close it's true 
If I was yours 
Mother, mother 
If I was your 
Mother, mother 
When love is blood 
You're never on trial 
Love don't get deeper 
Than a mother & child 
Oh baby, I got to get that 
Close to you 
Tell me what I got to do 
To make my life mean more to you 
I could get so close it's true 
If I was yours 
Tell me what I got to be 
To make you a part of me 
There's no one else you'd ever need 
If I was your 
Mother, mother 
If I was your mother 
Mother, mother 
Mother, mother 
If I was your mother 
Mother, mother
**Dry County
Across the border they turn 
Water into wine 
Some say it's the devil's blood 
They're squeezing from the vine 
Some say it's a saviour 
In these hard and desperate times 
You see it helps me to forget
That we're just born to die 
I came here like so many did 
To find a better life
To find my piece of easy street 
And finally be alive
I knew nothing good comes easy
All good things take some time
I made my bed I'll lie in it 
To die in it's the crime 
You can't help but prosper 
Where the streets are paved with gold 
They say the oil wells ran deeper here 
Than anybody's known 
Now I packed up on my wife and kid
And left them both back home
See there's nothing in this paydirt
The ghosts are all I know 
Now the oil's gone 
And the money's gone
All the jobs are gone
Still we're hangin' on 
Down in dry county 
They're swimming in the sand 
Praying for some holy water 
To wash these sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry 
Where nobody cries 
And no one's getting out of here alive 
Not this time
In the blessed name of Jesus 
I heard a preacher say 
We are all God's children 
That He'd be back, back someday 
Hoped that he knew 
Something as he drank his cup of wine 
I didn't have too good a feeling 
As I head out to the night 
I cursed the sky to open 
I begged the clouds for rain 
I prayed all night for water 
For this burning in my veins 
It was like my soul's on fire 
And I had to watch the flames 
Well, my dreams went up in ashes 
And my future blew away 
Now the oil's gone 
And the money's gone 
All the jobs are gone 
Still we're hangin' on 
Down in dry county 
They're swimming in the sand 
Praying for some holy water 
To wash these sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry 
Where nobody cries 
And no one's getting out of here alive 
Man spends his whole life
Waiting praying for some big reward
But it seems sometimes 
The payoff leaves you feeling 
Like a dirty whore 
If I could choose the way I'd die 
Make it by the gun or knife 
'Cause the other way there's too much pain 
Night after night after night after night
Down in dry county 
Where they're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water 
To wash these sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry 
Where nobody cries 
And no one's getting out of here
Dry county
No one's getting out of here
Dry county. No
**Woman In Love
Call it social commentary 
Call it just what me eyes see 
Seems that there's more pretty women 
Than there are fish in the sea 
...Woman in love 
You see there's girls who like your money 
Girls who like your car 
Girls who like to sip champagne 
And feed on caviar 
...Woman in love 
Send me some silk stockings 
Smooth talking lipstick and curls 
I want a woman 
More than a girl 
Need some lip-locking, cool walking 
Diamonds and pearls 
I'll wrap 'em all up 
And give them the world 
You know there ain't no woman 
Like a woman in love 
Ain't nothing 
She can't rise above 
She can part the water 
When the seas get rough 
But there ain't no woman 
Like a woman in love 
If lust is just a dirty dog 
I've been scratching with the fleas 
I've been waking up your neighbours 
Barking up your tree 
I went down to the shopping mall 
To get it off my mind 
But it's like sleeping with the enemy 
If you're not deaf and blind 
I tried to run 
But it was too late for me 
I tried to hide 
Since the day Adam met Eve 
Till I turned on the television 
And I looked up on the screen 
I saw a hundred pretty girls 
Sing this song on MTV 
Sen me some silk stockings 
Smooth talking lipstick and curls 
I want a woman 
More than a girl 
Need some lip-locking, cool walking 
Diamonds and pearls 
I'll wrap 'em all up 
And give them the world 
You know there ain't no woman 
Like a woman in love 
Ain't nothing she can't rise above 
She can part the water 
When the seas get rough 
There ain't no woman 
Like a woman in love 
There ain't secret 
To woman in love 
You think that you can 
Live without 'em 
But you're asking too much 
You see I've slept with romance 
And danced with lust 
But there ain't no woman 
Like a woman in love 
Oh, yeah 
I've traveled all around the world 
Across the seven seas 
Got everything I wanted 
There's just one thing I need 
It hasn't changed forever 
Fathers tell your sons 
That there ain't nothing like 
A thing called love 
You know there ain't no woman 
Like a woman in love 
Ain't nothing she can't rise above 
She can part the water 
When the seas get rough 
There ain't no woman 
Like a woman in love 
There ain't secret 
To woman in love 
You think that you can 
Live without 'em 
But you're asking too much 
You see I've slept with romance 
And danced with lust 
But there ain't no woman 
Like a woman in love 
Oh, yeah
**Fear
I see you looking over your shoulder 
Tell me who do you think's out there 
You're reaching for your four leaf clover 
But baby there ain't no luck down there 
I swear that there's no heart in this city 
It's here the slogan reads 
"Do your time" everybody's doing 
their sentence 
It's just there ain't nobody here 
Who knows just what's the crime 
I watched my father live a lie here 
I'd rather die than fade away 
I read the rules 
And yeah I know them 
Still you ain't ever gonna 
Make me play the game of 
Fear 
Fear 
Fear 
Fear 
Running with the rats 
Through the city 
Makes you feel like you're 
A partner in crime 
Girl once you won't stop to watch 
That little girl did 
Hey baby won't you stop and hear me 
Just being here we're 
breathing heart attacks 
We can run and chase 
The setting sun we can run 
And we won't ever look back 
Take my hand I know we'll make it 
I'll let nothing slow us down 
I know you want to curse 
This place but there's only 
One thing that's stopping us now 
Fear fear fear 
Of a new thing 
Fear fear fear 
Of the brass ring 
You ain't one for taking chances 
You work and live and breathe that 9 to 5 
Still that's what you call living 
That's surviving to me 
And surviving is living to die in 
Fear
**I Want You
The last time that I saw her
Was the night she said goodbye 
She said that love's a stranger 
And it's sure to pass you by
Yes she did
As she packed up her belongings 
Baby wouldn't look me in the eye
But I could see a tear roll off her face 
As we both tried
So hard not to cry
She said 
I never wanted the stars 
Never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are 
All I wanted was you 
So baby just turn away 
'Cause I can't face the truth
All I'm trying to say 
Is all I wanted was you 
I tried so hard to remember 
Where when how why love went away 
I tried to drown myself in pity 
But your memory kept calling my name
Yes it did
I bought you fancy cars and diamond rings
Baby
All the things that money brings 
And the servants to paint the skies blue
And I worked so hard seven days a week 
Built a fortress for your heart to keep
If I could I'd wrap these words up for you 
I never wanted the stars 
Never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are 
All I wanted was you 
So baby just turn away 
'Cause I can't face the truth
All I'm trying to say 
Is all I wanted was you 
I want you, I want you, baby I want you
But never thought you were alone 
I filled the party up with company 
But never made our house a home 
All I've got is my guitar these chords and the truth 
All I've got is my guitar but all I want
Baby all I want
I never wanted the stars
Never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are
All I wanted was you
So baby just turn away
'Cause I can't face the truth
All I'm trying to say
Is all I wanted was you
I want you, I want you, baby I want you
I never wanted the stars
I want you
I never shot for the moon
I want you
I like them right where they are
Baby I want you
So baby just turn away
I want you
'Cause I can't face the truth
I want you
All I wanted to say
Baby I want you
I never wanted the stars
I want you
I never shot for the moon
I want you
I like them right where they are
Baby I want you
So baby just turn away
I want you
**Blame It On The Love Of Rock & Roll
First time I heard the music 
I thought it was my own 
I could feel it in my heartbeat 
I could feel it in my bones 
My momma thinks I'm crazy 
My dad says I'm insane 
I got this boogie woogie fever 
That's burning in my veins 
They tried to take me to a doctor 
But it's too late for me 
Then they took me to a preacher 
That they saw on their TV 
Who said that for a small donation 
My lost soul would be saved 
I said I don't think so preacher 
I'll come back another day 
All I want, is to be a Rolling Stone 
They don't understand what we all know 
It feels so good that it ought to be illegal 
I got my vaccination from a phonograph needle 
I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old 
Blame it on the love of rock & roll 
My teachers didn't like me they always 
Tried to put me down 
'Cause I wore my hair too long 
I played my music way too loud 
Every little boy wants to learn to play guitar 
So he can pick up all the chicks 
And be a rock-n-roll star 
They said it won't last, but they misunderstood 
If people think it's bad then I'll be bad for good 
It feels so good that it ought to be illegal 
I got my vaccination from a phonograph needle 
I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old 
Blame it on the love of rock & roll 
Blame it on the love, blame it on the love 
Dad don't understand what the little girls know 
Blame it on the love of rock-n-roll 
All I wanted, all I ever needed 
My guitar gave to me 
Every song I've sung blame it on love 
Every war I've won blame it on love 
Everything I've done blame it on love 
Blame it on the love of rock-n-roll 
It feels so good that it ought to be illegal 
I got my vaccination from a phonograph needle 
I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old 
Blame it on the love of rock & roll 
Blame it on the love, blame it on the love 
Dad don't understand 
what the little girls know 
Blame it on the love of rock-n-roll
**Little Bit Of Soul
You been robbed 
You been used 
You been crucified and 
You been abused 
You been sacrificen and 
Now you're confused 
Ain't it the truth 
You got a hole in your head 
And a cold empty spot 
In your big brass bed 
When you're mad at the world and 
You feel like you're losing control 
All you need to get by is 
A little bit o soul 
When you've lost in the flood 
And you feel like you been 
Kicked through the mud 
You know they still 
Haven't found the drug 
To pick us up 
Feeling down, misunderstood 
You know these times 
They ain't looking so good 
When you're mad at the world and 
You feel like you're losing control 
What we all need to get by is 
A little o soul 
Whoa oh 
Little bit of soul 
What we all need 
To survive 
Is just 
A little bit o soul 
Everyone's complaining 
Nothing but frustration 
The king has pissed in 
Your pot of gold 
It ain't entertaining spending 
So much time in the hole 
Send down 
A little bit o soul 
When you're mad at the world 
And you feel like 
You're losing control 
What we all need 
To get by is just 
A little bit o soul 
Whoa oh little bit o soul 
Whoa oh little bit o soul 
Whoa oh little bit o soul
**Save A Prayer
Dear Lord, Jesus, Buddah, Allah or can I just call you Joe 
I've got a lot of things to tell you and some things I gotta know 
I'm tired of hearing talk about this world's about to end 
If we can die together then can't we all be friends 
I gotta know 
Hey, I gotta know 
So Mister can you tell me, gotta know 
Baby can you tell me, gotta know 
Whoa oh oh I gotta know 
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I gotta know 
Baby can you help me, gotta know 
I gotta know 
Did you ever feel like you were drowning, 
did you ever feel betrayed by a kiss? 
Did you ever feel like you needed somebody, 
would you feel alone in a world like this? 
Did you ever feel like you needed shelter, 
did you ever laugh when you wanted to cry? 
Did you ever dream about evolution, 
don't you ever feel like your living a lie? 
Oh, Whoa, too many children grow up blind to the truth. 
I say, Oh Oh, Oh, Oh, 
say a prayer for me, 
I'll save a prayer for you. 
Did you ever feel like you were helpless, 
did you ever feel like an open wound? 
Did you ever feel that there ain't no forgiveness, 
did you ever feel that close to the.truth. 
Oh Whoa, the world closed their eyes on the blinding truth. 
I say, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh , say a prayer for me, 
and I'll save a prayer for you 
I'll save a prayer for you, I'll save a prayer for you, 
I'll save a prayer.... for you, for you, for you. 
I'll save a prayer. 
Did you ever feel like you need shelter, 
did you ever feel like you lived through the flood? 
Did you ever feel a lust for survival, did you ever feel, feel, feel? 
The world keeps turning. 
Rooms still burning. 
There's too many hearts that haven't found a home. 
This train's on the tracks and the world's on my back, 
save a prayer for me and I'll save one for you. 
No one to blame , but it's hard to explain, 
why too many soul's are feeling so alone. 
You've got to hold on if it's all you can do. 
Save a prayer for me, I'll save a prayer for you. 
I'll save a prayer for you, I'll save a prayer for you, 
I'll Save a prayer.... 
for you, for you, for you.
**Always
This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But, baby, that's just me
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
And I know when I die,
You'll be on my mind
And I'll love you always
Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine
To say to you 'til the end of time
Yeah, I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you
Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But, baby, if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams and our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
And I know when I die,
You'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always
**Blaze Of Glory
I wake up in the morning
And I raise my weary head
I got an old coat for a pillow
And the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm going
Only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run
A six-gun lover
A candle in the wind
When you're brought into this world
They say you're born in sin
Well, at least they gave me something
I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well, they tell me that I'm wanted
Yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable
I'm what Cain was to Abel
Mister, catch me if you can
I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going down in a blaze of glory
And, Lord, I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm no one's son
Call me young gun
You ask about my conscience
And I offer you my soul
You ask if I'll grow to be a wise man
Well, I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I known love
And what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come
And I've seen it shot down
I've seen it die in vain
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son
Call me young gun
Each night I go to bed
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No, I ain't looking for forgiveness
But before I'm six-foot deep
Lord, I got to ask a favor
And I'll hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest
Let this boy die like a man
Staring down the bullet
Let me make my final stand
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first
But I drew first blood
And I'm no one's son
Call me young gun
I'm a young gun
Young gun
Young gun
**Someday I'll Be Saturday Night
Hey, man I'm alive I'm takin' each day and night at a time
I'm feelin' like a Monday but someday I'll be Saturday night
Hey, my name is Jim, where did I go wrong
My life's a bargain basement, all the good shit's gone
I just can't hold a job, where do I belong
I'm sleeping in my car, my dreams move on
My name is Billy Jean, my love was bought and sold
I'm only sixteen, I feel a hundred years old
My foster daddy went, took my innocence away
The street life ain't much better, but at least I get paid
And Tuesday just might go my way
It can't get worse than yesterday
Thursdays, Fridays ain't been kind
But somehow I'll survive
Hey man I'm alive I'm takin' each day and night at a time
Yeah I'm down, but I know I'll get by
Hey hey hey hey, man gotta live my life
Like I ain't got nothin' but this roll of the dice
I'm feelin' like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night
Now I can't say my name, and tell you where I am
I want to blow myself away, don't know if I can
I wish that I could be in some other time and place
With someone else's soul, someone else's face
Oh, Tuesday just might go my way
It can't get worse than yesterday
Thursdays, Fridays ain't been kind
But somehow I'll survive
Hey, man I'm alive I'm takin' each day and night at a time
Yeah I'm down, but I know I'll get by
Hey hey hey hey, man gotta live my life
I'm gonna pick up all the pieces and what's left of my pride
I'm feelin' like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night
Saturday night Here we go
Some day I'll be Saturday night
I'll be back on my feet, I'll be doin' alright
It may not be tomorrow baby, that's OK
I ain't goin' down, gonna find a way, hey hey hey
Hey man I'm alive I'm takin' each day and night at a time
Yeah, I'm down, but I know I'll get by
Hey hey hey hey, man, gotta live my life
Like I ain't got nothin' but this roll of the dice
I'm feelin' like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night
I'm feelin' like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night
Saturday night, all right, all right
Saturday night
**Hey God
Hey God, I'm just a little man got a wife and family 
But I almost lost the house 
Yeah, I bought into the dream 
We're barely holdin' on, when I'm in way to deep 
We're two paychecks away from living out on the streets 
She's a workin' single mom, like a Saint she doesn't complain 
She never says a word, but she thinks that she's to blame 
Her son just got convicted, he blew some punk away 
She did her best to raise him, but the world got in the way 
Hey God - Tell me what the hell is going on 
Seems like all the good shits gone 
It keeps on getting harder hanging on 
Hey God, there's nights you know I want to scream 
These days you've even harder to believe 
I know how busy you must be, but Hey God... 
Do you ever think about me 
Born into the ghetto in 1991, just a happy child 
Playing beneath the summer sun 
A vacant lots' his playground, by 12 he's got a gun 
The odds are bet against him, junior don't make 21 
Hey God - Tell me what the hell is going on 
Seems like all the good shits gone 
It keeps on getting harder hangin' on 
Hey God, there's nights you know I want to scream 
These days you've even harder to believe 
I know how busy you must be, but Hey God... 
I'd get down on my knees 
I'm going to try this thing you way 
Seen a dying man too proud to beg spit on his own grave 
Was he too gone to save? 
Did you even know his name? 
Are you the one to blame, I got something to say 
Hey God - Tell me what the hell is going on 
Seems like all the good shits gone 
It keeps on getting harder hangin' on 
Hey God, there's nights you know I want to scream 
These days you've even harder to believe 
I know how busy you must be, but Hey God... 
Do you ever think about me
**Something For The Pain
That's it come in
Why?
You can't swim
Happiness, it's been no friend to me
But "Forever After" ain't what it's all cracked up to be
Yeah, I had a taste, you were my fantasy
But I almost lost my faith when I hit reality
I don't need no guru to tell me what to do
When you're feeling like a headline on yesterday's news
Come on, come on, come on
Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when I feel I'm danglin' on a hangman's noose
Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel alright
Something like you
Come on, come on, come on
Loneliness has found a home in me
My suitcase and guitar are my only family
I've tried to need someone like they needed me
But I opened up my heart, but all I did was bleed
I don't need no lover just to get it screwed
They don't make no band-aid that's gonna cover my bruise
Come on, come on, come on
Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when I feel I'm danglin' on a hangman's noose
Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel alright
Something like you
Come on, come on, come on
(Help I'm falling)
Pull me under through my veins
To a place where I feel no pain
(Night is calling)
Be the pillow under my head
Cover me when I'm in your bed
(Feels like I'm flying)
Take me higher than I've ever been
Take me down and back again
(Christ I'm dying)
Come to me, be my disguise
Open your coat, let me crawl inside
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when I feel I'm danglin' on a hangman's noose
Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel alright
Something like you
Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when I feel I'm danglin' on a hangman's noose
Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel alright
Something like you
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Give me
Give me something for the pain
Give me
Give me something for the blues
Give me
Gotta to give me something for the pain baby
Give me
**This Ain't A Love Song
I should have seen it coming when roses died
Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
I should have listened when you said good night
You really meant good bye
Baby, ain't it funny, how you never ever learn to fall
You're really on your knees, when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are "know-it-alls" and I played that fool for you
I cried and I cried
There were nights that died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby
If the love that I got for you is gone
If the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
You and I were the renegades, some things never change
It made me so mad 'cause I wanted it bad for us baby
Now it's so sad that whatever we had, ain't worth saving
If the love that I got for you is gone
If the river I've cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yes I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
Is the reason that I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong - this ain't a love song
I cried and I cried
There were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy
If the love that I got for you is gone
If the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong - this ain't no love song
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
Is the reason that I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong - this ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
Is the reason that I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong - this ain't a love song
Yes, I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong - this ain't a love song
Yes, I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong - this ain't a love song
Yes, I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong - this ain't a love song
**These Days
I was walking around
Just a face in the crowd
Tryna keep myself out of the rain
Saw a vagabond king
Wear a Styrofoam crown
Wondered if I might end up the same
There's a man out on the corner
Singing old songs about change
Everybody's got their cross to bear these days
She came looking for some shelter
With a suitcase full of dreams
To a motel room on the boulevard
I guess she's tryna be James Dean
She's seen all the disciples and all the wanna-bes
No one wants to be themselves these days
Still there's nothing to hold on to but these days
These days the stars hang out of reach
These days there ain't a ladder on the streets
Oh, no, no
These days are fast
Nothing lasts
In this graceless age
There ain't nobody left but us these days
Jimmy Shoes busted both his legs
Tryna learn to fly
From a second story window
He just jumped and closed his eyes
His momma said he was crazy
He said, "Momma, I've gotta try
Don't you know that all my heroes died?
And I guess I'd rather die than fade away."
These days the stars hang out of reach
But these days there ain't a ladder on the streets
Oh, no, no
These days are fast
Nothing lasts
It's a graceless age
Even innocence has caught the midnight train
And there ain't nobody left but us these days
I know Rome's still burning
Though the times have changed
This world keeps turning
Round and round and round and round these days
These days the stars hang out of reach
But these days there ain't a ladder on the streets
Oh, no, no
These days are fast
Love don't last
It's a graceless age
Even innocence has caught the midnight train
These days the stars hang out of reach
These days there ain't a ladder on the streets
Oh, no, no
These days are fast
Nothing lasts
There ain't no time to waste
There ain't nobody left to take the blame
Oh, no, no
There ain't nobody left but us these days
Ain't nobody left but us these days
**Lie To Me
Rumour has it that your daddy's coming down 
He's gonna pay the rent 
Tell me baby, is this as good as life is gonna get 
It feels like there's a stranger standing in these shoes 
But, I know I can't lose me, 'cause then I'd be losing you 
I know I promised baby 
I would be the one to make our dreams come true 
I ain't too proud of all the struggles 
And the hard times we've been through 
When this cold world comes between us 
Please tell me you'll be brave 
'Cause I can realize the danger when forgiveness fades away 
If you don't love me - lie to me 
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe 
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be 
Right now if you don't love me baby - lie to me 
Pour another cup of coffee 
Babe I got something to say to you 
I ain't got the winning ticket 
Not the one that's gonna pull us through 
No one said that it'd be easy 
Let your old man take you home 
But know that if you walk out on me that darling 
I'd be gone 
If you don't love me - lie to me 
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe 
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be 
Right now if you can't love me baby - lie to me 
Baby, I can take it 
It's a bitch, but life's a roller coaster ride 
The ups and downs will make you scream sometimes 
It's hard believing that the thrill is gone 
But we got to go around again, so let's hold on 
If you don't love me - lie to me 
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe 
Let it all fall down around us 
If that's what's meant to be 
Right now if you can't love me baby - lie to me 
Lie to me 
Baby, I can take it 
C'mon lie to me
**Damned
I'm lying here beside you in someone else's bed 
Knowing what were doing's wrong 
But better left unsaid 
Your breathing sounds like screaming 
It's all that I can stand 
His ring is on your finger 
But my heart is in your hands 
Damned if you love me 
Damned if you don't 
It's getting harder holding on, but I can't let you go 
Damned if you don't need me 
Damned if you do 
God, I wish it wasn't me standin' in these shoes 
Damned, damned 
A door slams like a shotgun, you jump up to your feet 
But it's just the wind blowing through the secrets that we keep 
Made me want to want you, God knows I need to need you 
By the time the love is over, I'll be sleeping on the streets 
Damned if you love me 
Damned if you don't 
It's getting harder holding on, but I can't let you go 
Damned if you don't need me 
Damned if you do 
God, I wish it wasn't me standin' in these shoes 
Damned, damned 
Why don't you talk to me? (Because I'm too blind to see) 
Why don't you look at me? (Because I'm afraid to breath) 
What do you want from me? (All that I can stand) 
The lies are on my tongue and I can't turn back I know 
My soul is damned 
Don't worry 
I ain't gonna call you or hear you say my name 
And if you see me on the street, don't wave just walk away 
Our lives are getting twisted, let's keep our stories straight 
The more that I resist it, my temptation turns to fate 
Damned if you love me 
Damned if you don't 
It's getting harder holding on, but I can't let you go 
Damned if you don't need me 
Damned if you do 
God, I wish it wasn't me standin' in these shoes
**My Guitar Lies Bleeding In My Arms
Misery likes company, I like the way that sounds
I've been trying to find the meaning, so I can write it down
Staring out the window, it's such a long way down
I'd like to jump, but I'm afraid to hit the ground
I can't write a love song the way I feel today
I can't sing no song of hope, I got nothing to say
Life is feeling kind of strange, since you went away
I sing this song to you wherever you are
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms
I'm tired of watching TV, it makes me want to scream
Outside the world is burning, man it's so hard to believe
Each day you know you're dying from the cradle to the grave
I get so numb sometimes, that I can't feel the pain
I can't write a love song the way I feel today
I can't sing no song of hope I've got nothing to say
Life is feeling kind of strange, it's strange enough these days
I send this song to you, wherever you are
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms
Staring at the paper, I don't know what to write
I'll have my last cigarette-well, turn out the lights
Maybe tomorrow I'll feel a different way
But here I'm my delusion, I don't know what to say
I can't write a love song the way I feel today
I can't sing no song of hope, I've got nothing to say
And I can't fight the feelings, that are burning in my veins
I send this song to you, wherever you are
As my guitar lies bleeding
I can't write a love song the way I feel today
I can't sing no song of hope, there's no one left to save
And I can't fight the feelings buried in my brains
I send this song to you, wherever you are
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms
**(It's Hard) Letting You Go
It ain't no fun lying down to sleep 
And there ain't no secrets left for me to keep 
I wish the stars up in the sky 
Would all just call in sick 
And the clouds would take the moon out 
On some one-way trip 
I drove all night down streets that wouldn't bend 
But somehow they drove me back here once again 
To the place I lost at love, and the place I lost my soul 
I wish I'd just burn down this place that we called home 
It would all have been so easy 
If you'd only made me cry 
And told me how you're leaving me 
To some organ grinder's lullaby 
It's hard, so hard - it's tearing out my heart 
It's hard letting you go 
Now the sky, it shines a different kind of blue 
And the neighbor's dog don't bark like he used to 
Well - me, these days 
I just miss you - it's the nights that I go insane 
Unless you're coming back for me 
That's one thing I know that won't change 
It's hard, so hard - it's tearing out my heart 
It's hard letting you go 
Now some tarot card shark said I'll draw you a heart 
And we'll find you somebody else new 
But I've made my last trip to those carnival lips 
When I bet all that I had on you 
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard, so hard 
It's hard letting you go 
It's hard, so hard, it's tearing out my heart 
But it's hard letting you go
**Hearts Breaking Even
It's been a cold, cold, cold, cold night 
And I can't get you off of my mind 
God knows I've tried 
Did I throw away the best part of my life 
When I cut you off 
Did I cut myself with the same damn knife 
Hide my tears in the pouring rain 
Had my share of hurt and pain 
Don't say my name, run away, 'cause it's all in vain 
My hearts breaking even, now there's no use we even try 
Hey I cried, yeah I lied, hell I almost died 
Don't got a reason 
Let's just fold the cards and say good-bye 
It's all right, just two hearts breaking even tonight 
It's been a long, long, long, long time 
Since I've had your love here in my hands 
We didn't understand it, we couldn't understand it 
But, nothing's fair in love and hate 
You lay it all down and walk away, before it's too late 
We danced all night as the music played 
The sheets got tangled in the mess we made 
There in the stains, we remain 
No one left to blame 
My hearts breaking even, now there's no use we even try 
Hey I cried, yeah I lied, hell I almost died 
Don't got a reason 
Let's just fold the cards and say good-bye 
It's all right, just two hearts breaking even tonight 
Go on, get on with your life 
Yeah - I'll get on with mine 
Broken hearts can't call the cops 
Yeah - it's a perfect crime 
Twisting and turning the night keeps me yearning 
I'm burning alive 
I'm paying the price again 
But I'll see the light again 
My hearts breaking even, now there's no use we even try 
Hey I cried, yeah I lied, hell I almost died 
Don't got a reason 
Let's just fold the cards and say good-bye 
It's all right, just two hearts breaking even tonight
**Something To Believe In
I lost all faith in my God, in his religion too 
I told the angels they could sing their songs to someone new 
I lost all trust in my friends 
I watched my heart turn to stone 
I thought that I was left to walk this wicked world alone 
Tonight I'll dust myself off 
Tonight I'll suck my gut in 
I'll face the night and I'll pretend 
I got something to believe in 
And I had lost touch with reason 
I watched life criticize the truth 
Been waiting for a miracle 
I know you have too 
Though I know I won't win 
I'll take this one on the chin 
We'll raise a toast and I'll pretend 
I got something to believe in 
If I don't believe in Jesus, how can I believe the Pope 
If I don't believe in heroin, how can I believe in dope 
If there's nothing but survival, how can I believe in sin 
In a world that gives you nothing 
We need something to believe in 
If I don't believe in Jesus, how can I believe the Pope 
If I don't believe in heroin, how can I believe in dope 
If there's nothing but survival, how can I believe in sin 
In a world that gives you nothing 
We need something to believe in
**If That's What It Takes
I played the part of a broken heart upon a show 
I played that part so lonely and so well 
Thought that love belonged to someone else, not me and you 
Yeah, I know that you've been shattered 
You been bruised 
We both know what it feels like when you lose 
But I'd bet my life on a roll of the dice for you 
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do 
Tonite's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you 
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through 
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do 
If that's what it takes... 
I bet you counted all the tears I bet you've cried 
I bet you swore you'd never let love back inside 
'Cause it hurt youway too bad to say good-bye 
Now, there'll be times when I might put us to the test 
And it's hard for broken hearts to just forget 
But I'm driving blind, I'll lay it all on the line for you 
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do 
Tonite's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you 
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through 
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do 
If that's what it takes... 
So, when you feel like jumping 
Just when your heart starts pumping 
When you're stading out on that ledge-staring over the edge 
I'll be there to talk to you down 
I'll be there before you hit the ground 
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do 
Tonite's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you 
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through 
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do 
If that's what it takes... 
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do 
If we take the time to do it right, I know we'll put through 
If it took all my life, I'd prove it to you 
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do 
If that's what it takes...
**Diamond Ring
Diamond ring, wear it on your hand 
It's gonna tell the world, I'm your only man 
Diamond ring, diamond ring 
Baby, you're my everything, diamond ring 
Red, red rose brought it home to you 
Blood red rose, tells me that you're true 
Red, red rose, blood-red rose 
Like a fire inside that grows, blood-red rose 
When you're hungry, I will fill you up 
When you're thristy, drink out of my loving cup 
When you're crying, I'll be the tears for you 
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you 
When you're hungry, I will fill you up 
When you're thristy, drink out of my loving cup 
When you're crying, I'll be the tears for you 
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you 
You know, I bleed every night you sleep 
'Cause I don't know if I'm in your dreams 
I want to be your everything... 
Diamond ring, wear it on your hand 
It's gonna tell the world, I'm your only man 
Diamond ring, diamond ring 
Baby, you're my everything, diamond ring 
Darling, you're my everything, diamond ring 
Now, you've got me on your string... Diamond ring
**All I Want Is Everything
Some 15 year old kid sits on his porch, just half-past noon 
Trying to figure out just what he's doing 
Why he had to grow up so soon 
With all the gangs, all the guns-watcha gonna learn in school 
There's got to be some way out of here 
He says "Man, this life is cruel" 
I knew this Puerto Rican girl who lied to change her life 
She changed her name 
Her face because the grass looked greener on the other side 
She turned her back, she ran away straight into the night 
Her friends, her family feel the pain, but she's the one who cries 
Tell me what you want 
Tell me what you need 
I want everything 
I've had enough of havin' nothing, I won't take just anything 
I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything 
It's my life Mr. - I ain't running, I'm no puppet on a string 
I want more than I see coming 
All I want is everything 
All I want is everything 
My next door neighbor Donnie 
Died in his room just the other day 
His brother come home 
Found him dead on the floor with a needle in his vain 
Cops come down with a body bag 
They said Donnie was a casually 
I said, all it's about is the boy checked out 
He couldn't handle reality 
Tell me what you want 
Tell me what you need 
I want everything 
I've had enough of havin' nothing, I won't take just anything 
I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything 
It's my life Mr. - I ain't running, I'm no puppet on a string 
I want more than I see coming 
All I want is everything 
All I want is everything
**Bitter Wine
We met some time ago, when we were almost young 
It never crossed my mind to ask, where did you come from? 
I didn't have much money, so I stole you a rose 
You were dressed like an orphan, in Salvation Army clothes 
Once you were my inspiration, but, that river's run dry 
What was once holy water, tastes like bitter wine 
I know I wasn't funny, but you laughed at all my jokes 
When I was chaking on the words to say 
You shoved your finger down my throat 
The first night I said I loved you, you told me to go to hell 
You were giving he head, on that creeky 
Old bed at the Ol'Duvol Motel 
Once you were my inspiration, but, that river's run dry 
What was once holy water, tastes like bitter wine 
Once you were my inspiration, but, that river's run dry 
What was once holy water, tastes like bitter wine 
I would drink of your river, it would always get me high 
What was once my salvation, now tastes like bitter wine 
I never thought I'd love ya, no - I'd rather go blind 
I thought I saw the future, but the fortune teller lied 
I guess she lied 
Just like everything, even good love has to die 
Ain't no sympathy when it waves goodbye, no one even cried 
We were one of a kind 
I would drink of your river, it would always get me high 
What was once my salvation, now tastes like bitter wine 
I never thought I'd love ya, no - I'd rather go blind 
I thought I saw the future, but the fortune teller lied 
I guess she lied
**It's My Life
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud
It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said,
"I did it my way."
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky
Got to make your own breaks
It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said,
"I did it my way."
I just want to live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life
Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down
It's my life
And it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said,
"I did it my way."
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
And it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said,
"I did it my way."
I just want to live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life!
**Say It Isn't So
I just can't believe
It was all a lie
No man in the moon
Just a big light in the sky
I hear Disneyland
Might lose Mickey Mouse
In some giant hostile corporate shake-up
Tell me it's a nightmare
Please wake me up
(Say it isn't so)
I found a book of matches
From someplace we've never been
How come you hang the phone up
The minute I walk in
Last night I had this dream
That I was losing you
I woke up in a cold sweat shaking
Rescue me my heart is breaking
Say it isn't so (tell me it's not true)
Say it isn't so (I believe in you)
Tell me it's a lie (I don't need no proof)
Say everything's all right (couldn't be, not you)
Say it isn't so
Superman don't fly
They did it all with strings
Elvis Presley died
They deep fried the king
Like some tacky cheesy bathing beauty
Dancing on the beach in a bad b-movie
Say it isn't so (tell me it's not true)
Say it isn't so (I believe in you)
Tell me it's a lie (I don't need no proof)
Say everything's all right (couldn't be, not you)
Say it isn't so (don't give up on me)
Say it isn't so (don't give up on you)
Get me through the night (we'll make it through)
Make everything all right (couldn't be, not you)
Say it isn't so...
Say it isn't so (tell me it's not true)
Say it isn't so (I believe in you)
Tell me it's a lie (I don't need no proof)
Say everything's all right (couldn't be, not you)
Say it isn't so (don't give up on me)
Say it isn't so (don't give up on you)
Get me through the night (we'll make it through)
Make everything all right (couldn't be, not you)
Say it isn't so
**Thank You For Loving Me
It's hard for me to say the things
I wanna say sometimes
There's no one here but you and me
And that broken old street light
Lock the doors
Leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you
Are these five words tonight
Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes
When I couldn't see
For parting my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me
Thank you for loving me
I never knew I had a dream
Until that dream was you
When I look into your eyes
The sky's a different blue
Cross my heart
I wear no disguise
If I tried, you'd make believe
That you believed my lies
Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes
When I couldn't see
For parting my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me
You pick me up when I fall down
You ring the bell before they count me out
If I was drowning you would part the sea
And risk your own life to rescue me
Lock the doors
Leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you
Are these five words tonight
Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes
Oh, when I couldn't see
For parting my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me
When I couldn't fly
Oh, you gave me wings
You parted my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me
Thank you for loving me
Thank you for loving me
Oh, for loving me
Two Story Town
I couldn't sleep
Took a walk down Second Avenue
Sick of dreaming dreams that never come true
One way street and I know where its leading to
There's a "For Sale" sign on the front door of the city hall
The subway line got graffiti crawling off the wall
I could take a hit but I don't want to take the fall
That's just one side of the story
In this two story town
[Chorus:]
It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I want to take my car and drive out of this two story town
It's the same old shit going around
I'm going down, down ,down, down, down
In a two story town
There's a girl that I sleep with
She's got ecstasy eyes
He promised her roses and American pie
I called her and my demons
And I kissed them both goodbye
Seven days of Monday morning
In a two story town
[Chorus:]
It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I want to take my car and drive out of this two story town
It's the same old shit going around
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
In a two story town
One shot to make a move now
The ghosts are calling me out
[Guitar solo ]
And me I'm just one story
In a two story town
But you're never going to find me in the lost and found
[Chorus:]
It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I want to take my car and drive out of this two story town
It's the same old shit going around
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
In a two story town
[Chorus 2:]
It's just the same old sights and the same old sounds
I want to take my horse and drive out of this merry-go-round.
I won't give in and I won't back down
I'm going down, down, down, down down
Never going down, down, down, down, down
I ain't going down, down, down, down, down
In a two-story town
In this two story town
**Next 100 Years
Time ain't nothing but time 
It's a verse with no rhyme 
Man, it all comes down to you 
Change ain't nothing but change 
Just the faces and the names 
But you know we're gonna make it through 
I'll believe 
When you don't believe in anything 
[Chorus:]
I'm gonna hold you 'til your hurt is gone 
Be the shoulder that you're leaning on 
I'll be standing here 
For the next 100 years 
If it all should end tonight 
I'll know it was worth the fight 
And we'll be standing here 
For the next 100 years 
I, when I think that I'm losing my mind 
It all comes back to you 
And you, you know that it's true 
After all we've been through 
There's nothing that I wouldn't do 
Stand by me 
And I would gladly give up everything 
[Chorus:] 
I'm gonna hold you 'til your hurt is gone 
Be the shoulder that you're leaning on 
I'll be standing here 
For the next 100 years 
If it all should end tonight 
I'll know it was worth the fight 
And we'll be standing here 
For the next 100 years 
I'm gonna hold you 'til your hurt is gone 
Be the shoulder that you're leaning on 
I'll be standing here 
For the next 100 years 
If it all should end tonight 
I'll know it was worth the fight 
And we'll be standing here
For the next 100 years
**Just Older
Hey, man, it's been a while
Do you remember me?
When I hit the streets I was 17
A little wild, a little green
I've been up and down and in between
After all these years and miles of memories
I'm still chasing dreams
But I ain't looking over my shoulder
[Chorus:]
I like the bed I'm sleeping in
It's just like me, it's broken in
It's not old - just older
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans
This skin I'm in it's alright with me
It's not old - just older
It's good to see your face
You ain't no worse for wear
Breathing that California air
When we took on the world
When we were young and brave
We got secrets that we'll take to the grave
And we're standing here shoulder to shoulder
[Chorus:]
I like the bed I'm sleeping in
It's just like me, it's broken in
It's not old - just older
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans
This skin I'm in it's alright with me
It's not old - just older
I'm not old enough to sing the blues
But I wore the holes in the soles of these shoes
You can roll the dice 'til they call your bluff
But you can't win until you're not afraid to lose
[Solo]
Well, I look in the mirror
I don't hate what I see
There's a few more lines staring back at me
Now the nights has grown a little bit colder
Hey man, I gotta run
Now you take care
If you see coach T. Tell him I've cut my hair
I've kept my faith
I still believe I'm just...
Ha
[Chorus:]
I like the bed I'm sleeping in
It's just like me, it's broken in
It's not old - just older
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans
This skin I'm in it's alright with me
It's not old - just older
**Mystery Train
There are days when she's a whisper 
Nights when she's a scream 
A reason to wake up in the morning 
To close your eyes and dream 
She'll curse you like a sailor 
She'll wound you with her eyes 
She always makes it better 
But she won't apologize 
I know everything about her but don't know her at all 
[Chorus: ]
She's a ride on a mystery train 
To a place you've never been before 
Better hold on tight to that mystery train 
You're not in Kansas anymore 
She's a ride 
Mystery train 
She cries because she's happy 
She sings songs when she's mad 
Like a stiff drink when you need it 
She's good at being bad 
And long before you knew her you knew she was the one 
[Chorus: ]
She's a ride on a mystery train 
To a place you've never been before 
Better hold on tight to that mystery train 
You're not in Kansas anymore 
She's a ride 
Mystery train 
[Solo ]
I know everything about her but don't know her at all 
[Chorus:]
She's a ride on a mystery train 
To a place I've never been before 
Better hold on tight to that mystery train 
I'm not in Kansas anymore 
She's a ride 
On a mystery train 
She's a ride 
On a mystery train
**Save The World
I never went to college 
I don't have a degree 
Let's say I went to night school 
I learned all I know on the streets 
I wasn't born a rich man 
I ain't got no pedigree 
The sweat on this old collar 
That's my Ph.D. 
It comes down to this 
I wouldn't exist 
Without you it ain't worth the grind 
I'd fight for one kiss 
On a night like this 
You make me feel I could fly, like 
[Chorus:]
I could save the world 
Since the night your love saved me 
Maybe I can't save the world 
But as long as you believe 
Maybe I could save the world 
I got to confess 
Sometimes I'm a mess 
And sometimes I step out of line 
Like this old tattoo 
I ain't shiny or new 
With you by my side nothing matters 
[Chorus:] 
I can save the world 
Since the night your love saved me 
Maybe I can't save the world 
But as long as you believe 
Maybe I can save the world 
[Guitar solo ]
They can say it's blind love 
But it's a fool who don't believe 
That I'd fly all the way to the moon 
Just to walk you down your street 
[Chorus:] 
I can save the world 
Since the night your love saved me 
Maybe I can't save the world 
But as long as you believe 
Our love is even stronger 
Than god hoped it could be 
Baby, all it takes is 
Just a little faith in me 
To feel like 
I can save the world 
I can save the world
**Captain Crash And The Beauty Queen From Mars
Dressed up for a big date
Like Halloween day but it was Fourth of July now
A car crash with a suitcase
And a painted face
She was one of a kind
She wears a plastic crown like Cinderella
And roller skates in bed
He rides the greyhound
From his hometown
When he comes around
'Cause they don't let him drive now
Mixed-up as a milkshake
But make no mistake
Crash is lookin' like a star
You and me
We're invincible together
We can be also tragical, whatever
Dressed-up just like Ziggy but he couldn't play guitar
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from Mars
Share a toothpick,
Trading lipstick
Watching traffic
For days at the diner
Holding hands,
Making big plans
Playing Superman,
He was wearing eyeliner
Another local legend
And his longtime lucky charm
You and me
We're invincible together
We can be also tragical, whatever
All dressed up like Ziggy but he couldn't play guitar
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from Mars
They're drunk on love as you can get
Getting high on lust and cigarettes
Living life with no regrets
At least they're gonna try to fly
You and me
We're invincible together
We can be also tragical, whatever
We're Sid and Nancy
Fred and Ginger
Clyde and Bonnie
Liz and Richard
Kurt and Courtney
Bacall and Bogie
Joltin' Joe and Ms. Monroe
Here's captain Crash and the beauty queen from Mars
And you and me is Captain Crash and the beauty queen from Mars
**She's A Mystery
She won't let me buy her jewelry 
She don't want things that she can keep 
She wears wildflowers in her hair 
Then throws them in the sea 
She's the beginning and the end of me 
[Chorus:]
She's a mystery 
My most beautiful regret 
I will never understand her 
She's a mystery 
The only promise I can keep 
Even in my dreams she ruins me 
I still don't know what to call her 
She says that words don't mean a thing 
She changes her name every day 
And lies all the time 
I feel lucky to call her mine 
[Chorus:]
She's a mystery 
My most beautiful regret 
I will never understand her 
She's a mystery 
The only promise I can keep 
Even in my dreams she ruins me 
She's anything in the world 
That you cannot explain 
But when she throws me a smile 
It's fire in the rain 
[Chorus:]
She's a mystery 
My most beautiful regret 
'Cause she's a mystery 
The only promise I can keep 
Even in my dreams she ruins me 
She's a mystery 
There's no defense 
It's innocence 
But she won't let you see
'Cause she's a mystery
**I Got The Girl
It feels like I'm walkin' on air
When we walk down our street
When the neighbors stop to watch us walk by
You can hear 'em talking (let them talk)
Sometimes I think that you're the only reason
The sun still shines (when it shines)
And when this wicked world starts bringing me down
I tell myself that I'm one lucky guy
[Chorus:]
I got the girl (with all the cards)
I got the girl (she's a work of art)
I got the girl (who's gonna break my heart)
She says that someday she's gonna marry me
When that day comes that we walk down the aisle
She'll make me feel like a prince, a lord or a king
She likes to wear her stripe with her plaids
And she won't brush her hair (I swear)
She don't like wearing shoes in December
But I don't care (I don't care)
[Chorus:]
I got the girl (with all the cards)
I got the girl (she's a work of art)
I got the girl (who's gonna break my heart)
If I was a holy man I'd get down on my knees
So the angels that watch over her would give a break to me
Holy Mother of saint bubble gum and sister band-aid knees
Won't you please pray for the ones like me
[Solo]
But the truth is someday
Somebody is gonna take her (you see)
But the queen of hearts will always be
A five-year-old princess to me (to me)
[Chorus:]
I got the girl (with all the cards)
I got the girl (she's a work of art)
I got the girl (who's gonna break my heart)
I got the girl (she's gonna leave her mark)
I got the girl (she's a work of art)
I got the girl (she's gonna break your heart)
I got the girl
**One Wild Night
It's a hot night, the natives are restless 
We're sweating by the light of the moon 
There's a voodoo mojo brewing at the go-go 
That could knock a witch off her broom 
We slither on in and shed our skin 
Make our way into the bump and the grind 
So I'm passing by, she gives me the eye 
So I stop to give her a light 
[Chorus:] 
One wild night (blinded by the moonlight) 
One wild night (24 hours of midnight) 
One wild night (I stepped into the twilight zone 
And she left my heart with vertigo) 
One wild, one wild, one wild, one wild night 
Havin' as much fun as you can in your clothes 
Margarita had me feelin' alright 
It just might be that I found religion 
I've been on my knees for half of the night 
Then I'm rolling the bones with Jimmy 'no dice' 
Gonna take him for a couple weeks' pay 
Man, if you lose this roll I take your girlfriend home 
So I stopped 
But you're not gonna believe who comes walking out 
[Chorus:]
One wild night (blinded by the moonlight) 
One wild night (24 hours of midnight) 
One wild night (I stepped into the twilight zone 
And she left my heart with vertigo) 
One wild night (hey, c'est la vie) 
One wild night (welcome to the party) 
One wild night (life is for the living so 
You gotta live it up, come on let's go) 
One wild, one wild, one wild, one wild night 
[Guitar solo]
[Chorus:]
One wild night (blinded by the moonlight) 
One wild night (24 hours of midnight) 
One wild night (I stepped into the twilight zone 
And she left my heart with vertigo) 
One wild night (hey, c'est la vie) 
One wild night (welcome to the party) 
One wild night (life if for the living so 
You gotta live it up, come on let's go) 
One wild, one wild, one wild, one.. 
One wild night (blinded by the moonlight) 
One wild night (24 hours of midnight) 
One wild night (I stepped into the twilight zone) 
For one wild night 
One wild night (hey,c'est la vie) 
One wild night (welcome to the party) 
One wild night (life is for the living) 
All we've got is one wild night 
One wild night [4x]
One wild night blinded by the moonlight 
One wild night 24 hours of midnight 
One wild night stepped into the twilight zone for
One wild, one wild, one wild, one wild night.
**I Could Make A Living Out Of Loving You
If there's something that needs fixing
I'm the man to see
Look me up, I'm listed
Just check under "B"
If you're ever on the spot
Well, I'm good with my hands
24-7 I'm your handyman
Odd jobs, hard jobs, anything under the sun
Big jobs, small jobs, baby
[Chorus:]
I'd be a rich man, it's true
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
These two hands know what to do
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
I could make a living out of lovin' you
Until the work is finished
Well, I don't get paid
I don't mind getting dirty
That's my middle name
I'm in the service business
So I understand
Call me 24-7, I'm your handyman
Odd jobs, hard jobs, anything under the sun
Big jobs, small jobs, baby
[Chorus:]
I'd be a rich man, it's true
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
These two hands know what to do
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
[Solo ]
Tough jobs, rough jobs, say where and when
I'll leave you my card, call when you need me again
Odd jobs, hard jobs, baby
[Chorus:]
I'd be a rich man, it's true
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
These two hands know what to do
If I could make a living out of lovin' you
I'd be a rich man, it's true
I could make a living out of lovin' you
I'm a rich man
I could make a living out of lovin' you
**Undivided
That was my brother lost in the rubble
That was my sister lost in the crush
That was our mothers, those were our children
That was our fathers, that was each one of us
A million prayers to God above
A million tears make an ocean of
[Chorus:]
One for love
One for truth
One for me, one for you
I found spirit, they couldn't ruin it
I found courage in the smoke and dust
I found faith in the songs you silenced
Deep down it's ringing out in each of us
Yeah... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus:]
One for love
One for truth
One for me, one for you
Where we once were divided, now we stand united
We stand as one... undivided.
How many hands? How many hearts?
How many dreams been torn apart?
Enough, enough... the time has come to rise back as
[Chorus:]
One for love
One for truth
One for me, one for you
Where we once were divided now we stand united
We stand as one... undivided.
Undivided.
Undivided.
One for love
One for truth
One for me, one for you
Where we once were divided, now we stand united
We stand as one... undivided.
**Everyday
I used to be the kind of guy
Who'd never let you look inside
I'd smile when I was crying
I had nothing but a life to loose
Thought I had a lot to prove
In my life there's no denying
Goodbye to all my yesterdays
Goodbye, so long, I'm on my way
I've had enough of cryin'
Bleedin', sweatin', dyin'
Hear me when I say
Gonna live my life everyday
I'm gonna touch the sky
And I spread these wings and fly
I ain't here to play
I'm gonna live my life everyday
Change, everybody's feeling strange
Never gonna be the same
Makes you wonder how the world keeps turning
Life, learning how to live my life
Learning how to pick my fights
Take my shots while I'm still burning
Goodbye to all those rainy nights
Goodbye, so long, I'm moving on
I've had enough of cryin'
Bleedin', sweatin', dyin'
Hear me when I say
Gonna live my life everyday
I'm gonna touch the sky
And I spread these wings and fly
I ain't here to play
I'm gonna live my life everyday
Hit the gas, take the wheel
I've just made myself a deal
There ain't nothing gonna get in my way
Everyday
Goodbye, so long, I'm moving on
I've had enough of cryin'
Bleedin', sweatin', dyin'
Hear me when I say
Gonna live my life everyday
I'm gonna touch the sky
And I spread these wings and fly
I ain't here to play
I'm gonna live my life everyday
I, oh I, oh I, I'm gonna live my life everyday
I (gonna touch the sky), oh I (spread these wings and fly), oh I
I'm gonna live my life everyday
**The Distance
There's a train out in the distance, destination still unknown
Far away where no one's waiting, so far from home, so far from home
There's a rose outside your window, the first snow is falling down
Like that lonesome whistle blowing
I keep on going, keep on going...
[Chorus:]
Close your eyes and see my blue skies breaking through these dark clouds
You are the light
In my mind I see your red dress and your arms are reaching through the night
I'll never give up the fight
I'll go the distance
There's a thread that runs between us pulling 'cross this great divide
It's only there for the believers
Don't stop believing, don't stop believing
[Chorus:]
Close your eyes and see my blue skies breaking through these dark clouds
You are the light
In my mind I see your red dress and your arms are reaching through the night
I'll never give up the fight
I'll go the distance, I'll go the distance
There's a neverending story that begins with you and I
Like the rose outside your window
Don't let it die, don't let it die
[Chorus:]
Close your eyes and see my blue skies breaking through these dark clouds
You are the light
In my mind I see your red dress and your arms are reaching through the night
Close your eyes and see my blue skies breaking through these dark clouds
You are the light
In my mind I see your red dress and my arms are reaching through the night
I'll never give up the fight
I'll go the distance
**Joey
Joey Keys was from my neighborhood
Some would say that he was bad and Joe thought that was good
Joey got the name "Keys" picking locks
He never really robbed no one; it sure amused the cops
Joey's parents owned a restaurant
After closing time they'd give us almost anything we'd want
I never cared that Joey Keys was slow
Though he couldn't read or write too well but we'd talk all night long.
Come on, come on, come on
What you gonna do with your life?
Come on, come on, come on
Chasing sparks in the nights
His old man said tomorrow is a ride that goes nowhere
But I'll pull some strings, get blackbird wings
And break us out of here
[Chorus:]
Hey Joey
C'mon tell me 'bout your dreams
Tell me all the sights you're gonna see
Tell me who you're gonna be
Hey Joey
You're gonna kiss the girls goodnight
Sometimes you got to stand and fight
It'll be alright
We're gonna find a better life
See Joe was 3 years younger to the day
Acting like a little brother but became my ball and chain
I met this girl named Rhonda, she fell for me
She said, "I might learn to like him but love ain't built for three."
[Chorus]
Hey Joey
News gets around in this fading neighborhood
The old man lost the restaurant
He drinks more than he should
It's time for Joey keys to do some good
Pick the lock off our lives, let's get out of here like we always said we would
[Chorus]
We're gonna find a better life
Find a better life
Find a better life
**Misunderstood
Should I? Could I?
Have said the wrong things right a thousand times
If I could just rewind, I see it in my mind
If I could turn back time, you'd still be mine
You cried, I died
I should have shut my mouth, things headed south
As the words slipped off my tongue, they sounded dumb
If this old heart could talk, it'd say you're the one
I'm wasting time when I think about it
[Chorus:]
I should have drove all night, I would have run all the lights
I was misunderstood
I stumbled like my words, Did the best I could
Damn, misunderstood
Could I? Should I?
Apologize for sleeping on the couch that night
Staying out too late with all my friends
You found me passed out in the yard again
You cried, I tried
To stretch the truth, but didn't lie
It's not so bad when you think about it
[Chorus:]
I should have drove all night, I would have run all the lights
I was misunderstood
I stumbled like my words, did the best I could
Damn, misunderstood
Intentions good
[Guitar Solo]
It's you and I, just think about it...
[Chorus:]
I should have drove all night
I would have run all the lights
I was misunderstood
I stumbled like my words, did the best I could
I 'm hanging outside your door
I've been here before
Misunderstood
I stumbled like my words, did the best I could
Damn, misunderstood
Intentions good.
**All About Loving You
Looking at the pages of my life
Faded memories of me and you
Mistakes you know I've made a few
I took some shots and fell from time to time
Baby, you were there to pull me through
We've been around the block a time or two
I'm gonna lay it on the line
Ask me how we've come this far
The answer's written in my eyes
[Chorus:]
Every time I look at you, baby, I see something new
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more
I don't wanna sleep tonight, dreamin's just a waste of time
When I look at what my life's been comin' to
I'm all about lovin' you
I've lived, I've loved, I've lost, I've paid some dues, baby
We've been to hell and back again
Through it all you're always my best friend
For all the words I didn't say and all the things I didn't do
Tonight I'm gonna find a way
[Chorus:]
Every time I look at you, baby, I see something new
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more
I don't wanna sleep tonight, dreamin's just a waste of time
When I look at what my life's been comin' to
I'm all about lovin' you
You can take this world away
You're everything I am
Just read the lines upon my face
I'm all about lovin' you
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus:]
Every time I look at you, baby, I see something new
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more
I don't wanna sleep tonight, dreamin's just a waste of time
When I look at what my life's been comin' to
I'm all about lovin' you
All about lovin' you
**Hook Me Up
Hello, is there anybody out there?
I'm alone hanging by a thread
Everywhere around the world
Everybody's waiting for someday
Calling out around the world
Maybe someday might be tonight
[Chorus:]
Hook me up
I'm reaching out for you, come on
Hook me up
I know you can do it, come on, take me on
Are you there? 
Tell me what you're feeling.
Your fears and all your wildest dreams
Everyone around the world 
Is feeling just the same way that we are
Reaching out around the world
Will someone somewhere throw me a line?
[Chorus:]
Hook me up
I'm reaching out for you, come on
Hook me up
I know you can do it, come on, take me on
Save me, save me
Save me, save me
Hello, is there anybody out there?
[Guitar Solo]
Calling out around the world
Maybe someday might be tonite
[Chorus:]
Hook me up
I'm reaching out for you, come on
Hook me up
I know you can do it, come on, take me on
Hook me up
I'm hanging on the line, come on
Hook me up
Make me come alive, come on, take me on
Save me, save me,
Save me, save me
**Right Side Of Wrong
A friend of a friend needs a favor
No questions asked, there's not much more to say
Me and the wife, we need the money
We've got four kids all hungry, one on the way
Slip these sweat socks in your shirt and pray they think your packin'
Be sure to keep your head down, don't look 'em in the eye
And don't get fancy, Ricky, we ain't Jimmy Cagney
Look at me, let's do the job and let's get home tonight
[Chorus:]
I got a half tank of gas and if we run all the lights
We'll slip across the border on the wrong side of right
And just like Butch and Sundance we'll ride until the dawn
Sipping whiskey, singing cowboy songs 
On the Right Side of Wrong
We picked a helluva of a night, from the shore I see the skyline
In a couple of hours from now Rick, we're gonna get out of this life
We'll stop for smokes, I brought a six pack, we'll stop at lookers on the way back
Hell, we'll laugh this off, keep your fingers crossed that all goes well tonight
[Chorus:]
I got a half tank of gas and if we run all the lights
We'll slip across the border on the wrong side of right
And just like Butch and Sundance we'll ride until the dawn
Sipping whiskey, singing cowboy songs 
On the Right Side of Wrong
We'll make the grade, they'll know our names, I need a friend to drive here
Wear my necklace of St. Christopher and talk to him while I go inside
I'll take that suitcase, get the cash and we'll be gone before you know
Wait until we tell the girls we're moving down to the Gulf of Mexico...
[Guitar Solo]
A friend of a friend needed a favor
Life was just what happened while we were busy making plans
We never saw nothing, there was a run-in
.9 millimeter steel was coming for the windshield of that Oldsmobile
As the cop said, "Show your hands!"
[Chorus:]
I got a half tank of gas and if we run all the lights
We'll slip across the border on the wrong side of right
And just like Butch and Sundance we'll ride until the dawn
Sipping whiskey, singing cowboy songs 
On the Right Side of Wrong
**Love Me Back To Life
This world don't give you nothing it can't take away
Everybody holding on to something
Nobody wants to fade away
No forgiveness on the streets of this town
I left my patience at a traffic light
There's no denying that I almost lost it
Threw in the towel, too tired to fight
Tonight I need you
More than yesterday
Tonight I need you
[Chorus:]
Take me, touch me, hold me like you mean it
Make me come alive
Hurt me, heal me, come and make me feel it
Rescue me tonight
Love me back to life
These days I'd trade sight for feeling
There are days my feeling's gone
Can't figure out whose life I'm living
I don't know right from wrong
When I lost my faith 
You found it and gave it back to me
There's a new light on your halo; it took blind eyes to see
That I need you
More than yesterday
Yeah, I need you
[Chorus:]
Take me, touch me, hold me like you mean it
Make me come alive
Hurt me, heal me, come and make me feel it
Rescue me tonight
Love me back to life
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus:]
Take me, touch me, hold me like you mean it
Make me come alive
Hurt me, heal me, come and make me feel it
Rescue me 
Take me, touch me, hold me like you mean it
Make me come alive
Hurt me, heal me, come and make me feel it
Rescue me tonight
Love me back to life
Love me back to life
Love me back to life
Love me back to life
**You Had Me From Hello
At the mirror you fix your hair and put your makeup on
You're insecure about what clothes to wear
I can't see nothing wrong
To me you look so beautiful when you can't make up your mind
It's half past eight, it's getting late
It's OK, take your time
Standing here my hands in my pockets
Like I have a thousand times
Thinking back it took one breath
One word to change my life
[Chorus:]
The first time I saw you it felt like coming home
If I never told you I just want you to know
You had me from hello
When we walk into a crowded room it's like we're all alone
Everybody tries to kidnap your attention
You just smile and steal the show
You come to me and take my hand
We start dancin' slow
You put your lips up to my ear and whisper way down low
[Chorus:]
From the first time I saw you it felt like coming home
If I never told you I just want you to know
You had me from hello
And when you're laying down beside me
I feel your heartbeat to remind me...
[Chorus:]
The first time I saw you it felt like coming home
If I never told you I just want you to know
You had me from hello
From hello
From hello
Bounce
I been knocked down so many times
Counted out 6, 7, 8, 9
Written off like some bad deal
If you're breathing you know how it feels
Call it karma, call it luck
Me, I just don't give a 
[Chorus:]
Bounce, Bounce Nothing's gonna keep me down
Bounce, Bounce Stand up, shout it out
Bounce, Bounce I play hard, I play to win
Count me out, count me in
I'll be bouncing back again
This ain't no game; I play it hard
Kicked around, cut, stitched and scarred
I'll take the hit but not the fall
I know no fear, still standing tall
You can call it karma, call it luck
Me, I just don't give a 
[Chorus:]
Bounce, Bounce Nothing's gonna keep me down
Bounce, Bounce Stand up, shout it out
Bounce, Bounce I play hard, I play to win
Count me out, count me in
I'll be bouncing back again
Bounce!
[Guitar Solo]
Bring it on, I like it rough
In your face, I call your bluff
It ain't karma, it ain't luck
Me, I just don't give a 
[Chorus:]
Bounce, Bounce Nothing's gonna keep me down
Bounce, Bounce Stand up, shout it out
Bounce, Bounce I play hard, I play to win
Count me out, count me in
I'll be bouncing back again
Bounce, Bounce 
Nothing's gonna keep me down
Bounce, Bounce Stand up, shout it out
Bounce, Bounce I play hard, I play to win
Count me out, count me in
I'll be bouncing back again
**Open All Night
I saw you coming from a mile away
Trying to hide behind that pretty face
Bet my last dollar baby you been bruised
Poor little heart all black 'n' blue
Last thing you need's another pickup line
You must have heard them all a thousand times
God only knows what you been through
Believe me I been broken too
It aches, it breaks, it takes your breath away
I've been around that block a time or two
[Chorus:]
Baby, I don't want to fall in love with you
I try, try, try but I can't get around the truth
Please don't say my name, give this heart a break
I don't want to make the same mistake but it's too late
I'll leave on the light
These arms are open all night
I got your taste in the back of my mouth
I want to reach in and pull it out
And I'd be lying if I didn't say
When you're this close I'm afraid
Of the way I'll feel if I touch your hair
The way I'll miss you when you're not there
And that I'll see you when I close my eyes
It's too late, I've crossed that line
It breaks, it aches, it takes your breath away
I'll still be around come closing time
[Chorus:]
Baby, I don't want to fall in love with you
I try, try, try but I can only tell the truth
Please don't say my name, give this heart a break
I don't want to make the same mistake but it's too late
I'll leave on the light
These arms are open all night
[Guitar solo]
It's 2 am, it's last call, baby. The barkeep's gone, I'll walk you home now
Save me, baby
[Chorus:]
Baby, I don't want to fall in love with you
I try, try, try but I can only tell the truth
Please don't make me beg, give this heart a break
I don't want to make the same mistake but it's too late
I'll leave on the light
These arms are open all night
**Have A Nice Day
Why you wanna tell me how to live my life?
Who are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand.
Is innocence the difference 'tween a boy and a man?
My daddy lived a lie. That's just the price that he paid.
Sacrificed his life just slavin' away.
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto,
That gets me through the night,
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to.
I'm gonna live my life.
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice,
Standing on the ledge I show the wind how to fly.
When the world gets in my face,
I say,
"Have a nice day!
Have a nice day!"
Take a look around you. Nothing's what it seems.
We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams.
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand
Of anybody brave enough to take a stand.
I've knocked on every door on every dead-end street
Looking for forgiveness and what's left to believe?
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto,
That gets me through the night,
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to.
I'm gonna live my life.
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice,
Standing on the ledge I show the wind how to fly.
When the world gets in my face,
I say,
"Have a nice day!
Have a nice day!"
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto,
That gets me through the night,
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to.
I'm gonna live my life.
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice,
Standing on the ledge I show the wind how to fly.
When the world gets in my face,
I say,
"Have a nice day!
Have a nice day!
Have a nice day!"
When the world keeps trying to drag me down,
Gotta raise my hand, gonna stand my ground.
I say,
"Have a nice day!
Have a nice day!
Have a nice day!"
**I Want To Be Loved
I had a roof overhead
Had shoes on my feet
Sure I was fed, but no-one was there
When I was in need, yeah
So who am I now?
Who do you want me to be?
I can forgive you, but I won't relive you
I aint the same scared kid I used to be
[Chorus]
I'm gonna live
I'm gonna survive
Don't want the world to pass me by
I'm gonna dream
I aint gonna die
Thinking my life was just a lie
I wanna be loved
I wanna be loved
I found a picture
Our so-called family tree, yeah
I broke all the branches, looking for answers
Don't you know that aint how it's supposed to be
[Chorus]
I'm gonna live
I'm gonna survive
Don't want the world to pass me by
I'm gonna dream
I ain't gonna die
Thinking my life was just a lie
I wanna give
I'm ready to try
Willing to lay it on the line
I wanna be loved
I wanna be
I aint gonna cry
I dont wanna scream
But i got so much left unsaid inside of me
[Chorus]
I just wanna be loved
I wanna be loved
**Welcome To Wherever You Are
Maybe we're different, but we're still the same
We all got the blood of Eden, running through our veins
I know sometimes it's hard for you to see
You come between just who you are and who you wanna be
If you feel alone, and lost and need a friend
Remember every new beginning, is some beginning's end
[Chorus]
Welcome to wherever you are
This is your life, you made it this far
Welcome, you gotta believe
That right here right now, you're exactly where you're supposed to be
Welcome, to wherever you are
When everybody's in, and you're left out
And you feel your drowning, in a shadow of a doubt
Everyones a miracle in their own way
Just listen to yourself, not what other people say
When it seems you're lost, alone and feeling down
Remember everybody's different
Just take a look around
[Chorus]
Be who you want to, be who you are
Everyones a hero, everyones a star
When you wanna give up, and your hearts about to break
Remember that you're perfect, God makes no mistakes
[Chorus]
**Who Says You Can't Go Home
I spent 20 years tryna get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
I been there, done that
And I ain't lookin' back
On the seeds I've sown
Saving dimes
Spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy born a rolling stone
Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I've had a million miles of memories on that road
With every step I take I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy born a rolling stone
Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home
I been there, done that
And I ain't looking back
It's been a long long road
Feels like I never left
That's how the story goes
It doesn't matter where you are
It doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles away
Or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy born a rolling stone
Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home
**Last Man Standing
Come see a living, breathing spectacle
Only seen right here
It's your last chance in this lifetime
The line forms at the rear
You won't believe your eyes
Your eyes will not believe your ears
Get your money out, get ready
Step right up, yeah you, come here
You ain't seen nothing like him
He's the last one of the breed
You better hold on to your honey
Honeys, don't forget to breathe
Enter at your own risk, mister
It might change the way you think
There's no dancers, there's no diamonds
No this boy he don't lip synch
[Chorus]
Here's the last man standing
Step right up, he's the real thing
The last chance of a lifetime
Come and see, hear, feel, the real thing
See those real live calloused fingers
Wrapped around those guitar strings
Kiss the lips where hurt has lingered
It breaks the heart to hear him sing
The songs were more than music They were pictures from the soul
So keep your pseudo-punk, hip-hop, pop-rock junk
And your digital downloads
[Chorus]
Take your seats now, folks. It's show time.
Hey, Patrick hit the lights
There's something in the air
There's magic in the night
Now here's the band, they really play
I'll count the first one in
I don't know where it's going
We all know where it's been
[Chorus x2]
**Bells Of Freedom
I have walked all alone
On these streets, I call home
Streets of hope, streets of fear
Through the sidewalk cracks
Time dissapears
I was lost, on my knees
On the eve of defeat
As i choked back the tears
There's a silent scream no-one could hear
So far away from everything, you know it's true
Something inside that makes you know what you've got to do
[Chorus]
Ring the bells, ring them loud
Let them ring here and now
Just reach out and ring the bells of freedom
When your world's crashing down like you've lost every round
Stand your ground
And ring the bells of freedom
Up the steps of the church
Through the fields in the dirt
In the dark I have seen
That the sun still shines for the one who believed
So far away, so full of doubt, you needed proof
Just close your eyes, and hear the sound inside of you
[Chorus x3]
**Wildflower
She wakes up when I sleep
To talk to ghosts like in the movies
If you don't follow what I mean
I sure don't mean to be confusing
They say when she laughs she wants to cry
She'll draw a crowd then try to hide
Don't know if it's her or just my mind I'm losing
Nobody knows a wildflower still grows
By the side of the road 
And she don't need to need like the roses
Wildflower
That girl's sure put a spell on me
Yeah, her voodoos hidden right behind her pocket
If she's fire, I'm gasoline
Yeah, we fight a lot but neither wants to stop it
Well, she'll tell you she's an only child until you meet her brothers
Swear she's never met the man she couldn't make into a lover
[Chorus]
Nobody knows a wildflower still grows
By the side of the road
And she don't need to need like the roses
She's at home with the weeds
And just as free as the night breeze
She's got the cool of a shade tree
She's growin' on me and I can't live with out her
Yesterday's a memory
Tomorrow's accessory
That's her favorite quote about regret
Well, she'll tell you about her pedigree
With a sailor's mouth he'd have left at sea and it ain't over yet
[Chorus]
Nobody knows [x3]
That's right
She wakes up when I sleep
To talk to ghosts like in the movies
**Last Cigarette
Regrets are all you left, on your lipstick stains
Take a picture of our past there in that ashtray
We had our fun, I used to light your flame
Like the dancing smoke that rose we tried to find our way
No one told me, she told me
Your love's like one last cigarette
Last cigarette, I will savor it
The last cigarette
Take it in and hold your breath, hope it never ends
But when it's gone, it's gone
The last cigarette
Just to breathe reminds me of what used to be
The smoke's the ghost that keeps you close when I can't sleep
Don't ask the past to last, it's about to change
The memories don't answer when I call your name
No one told me, she told me
[Chorus]
Your love's like one last cigarette
Last cigarette, I will savor it
The last cigarette
Take it in and hold your breath, hope it never ends
But when it's gone, it's gone
One last cigarette, last cigarette
One I can't forget, the last cigarette
Right there at my fingertips, got your taste still on my lips
Right or wrong
You're still gone, gone, gone
No one told me, she told me
You always lose the girl in a Brian Wilson world
[Chorus]
No one told me, she told me
The Last Cigarette
**I Am
How you spend your minutes are what matters
All tomorrows come from yesterday's
When you're feeling broke and bruised and sometimes shattered
Blew out the candles on the cake like everything's a big mistake
It seems you always wait for life to happen
And your last buck can't buy a lucky break
If all we've got is us then lifes worth living
And if you're in, you know I'm in
I'm ready and I'm willing
[Chorus]
I Am
When you think that no-one needs you
Sees you or believes you
No ones there to understand
I Am
I'll be there to be that someone
When you think that no one, is there to hold your hand
I Am
We're just who we are, there's no pretending
It takes a while to learn to live in your own skin
Say a prayer that we might find our happy ending
And if you're in, you know I'm in
I'm ready and I'm willing
[Chorus]
And I aint got no halo hanging over my head
I aint gonna judge you, I'm just here to love you
I Am
I Am
[Chorus x2]
**Complicated
Take a look around, this is what I see
Is there anybody else that feels like me?
You sweat, you sweat
You bleed, you bleed
What you get aint what you see
Up is down and black is white to me
[Chorus]
I'm complicated
I get frustrated
Right or wrong, love or hate it
I'm complicated
Can't sudate it
I heard that song, but i won't play it
It's alright
It's okay
You wouldn't want me any other way
Momma, keep on praying, cause I aint changing
I'm complicated
Complicated, Yeah
I'm smart enough to know what I don't know
I'm fool enough to stay when I should go
You work, you work
You cry, you cry
You watch your whole life pass you by
Sometimes you gotta close your eyes to see
[Chorus]
Is there anybody out there
Just like everybody out there
Just want somebody out there just like me
[Chorus]
Is there anybody out there
Just like everybody out there
Just want somebody out there just like me [x2]
**Novocaine
You can take back all your secrets
We'll divide up all the lies
Keep all the pictures in their frames
Cut me out, yeah I'll be fine
Tell the neighbours all my feelings
Go on and give away all my pride
It's hard to laugh and cry, live and die every night
Keep your rolodex of friends
And all the remnants can be mind
I guess there'll be no happy endings
When once upon is doing time
There's a different kind of meaning now
To living on a prayer
Some don't seem to notice
And the rest don't seem to care
[Chorus]
I tell myself I (feel no pain)
But I'm feeling the pain (walk away)
Can't walk away
I'm hanging on the ropes of hope
It's getting hard to cope you know
When you're the needle running
through my veins
I've changed my name to novocaine 
You put my favorite belongings in a box in the garage (let's get this straight)
You burned my favorite sweats from high school 
Tried to sell my muscle car (that's not OK)
You're mother's gonna visit for a couple months this year
They say you do the crime, you do the time
It's all so clear
[Chorus]
Well things ain't what they used to be
It's a sleepless, self-help century
I'm up to here with Dr. Phil and the modern man in me
[Chorus x2]
Novocaine [x3]
**Story Of My Life
Yesterdays a memory
Another page in history
You sell yourself on hopes and dreams 
That leaves you feeling sideways.
Tripping over my own feet 
Trying to walk to my own beat
Another car out on the street trying to find the Highway 
Yeah, Are you going my way?
[Chorus]
This is the story of my life 
And I write it everyday
I know it isn't black and white 
And it's anything but grey
I know that no I'm not alright, but I feel ok cos 
Anything can, everything can happen 
That's the story of my life
I gonna write the melody 
That's gonna make history, 
And when I paint my masterpiece I swear I'll show you first 
There just ain't a way to see who and why or what will be 
Till now is then 
It's a mystery, it's a blessing and a curse 
Or something worse
[Chorus]
This is the story of my life 
And I write it everyday, 
And I hope you're by my side when I'm writing the last page
[Chorus x2]
**Dirty Little Secret
I light a candle
In the garden of love
To blind the angels
Looking down from above
I want, I need
The fruit of your pine
It tastes so bitter sweet
Cause I know it's not mine
I want to come inside
Hit the lights
And I'll come crawling to your window tonight
Come on and send the sign
I'll be your dirty little secret and you'll be mine
You got me knock knock knocking at your door
And I'll be coming back for more
We made a promise and we keep it
Our dirty little secret
We act like strangers
When you're holding his hand
Cause there's a danger
That we both understand
We run like thiefs
Through the temple of sin
Till we fall on our knees then you go back to him
I want to feel alive
Hit the lights
And I'll come crawling to your window tonight
Come on and send the sign
I'll be your dirty little secret and you'll be mine
You got me knock knock knocking at your door
And I'll be coming back for more
We made a promise and we keep it
Our dirty little secret
Hit the lights
And I'll come crawling to your window tonight
Come on and send the sign
I'll be your dirty little secret and you'll be mine
You got me knock knock knocking at your door
And I'll be coming back for more
We made a promise and we keep it
Our dirty little secret
Our dirty little secret
Our dirty little secret
Our dirty little secret
Our dirty little secret
**Unbreakable
You said you made me and you break me
You said it ain't hard to shake me
You threw me ever since you've taken me down
You came like a rainy grey monday
I prayed like it was a sunday
You say, you say
But I won't run away, I'll be standing my ground
Seen all the screaming and fighting
Lived through the screaming and lying
I'm fine, you can't deny
I'm unbreakable, unstoppable, I'm invincible
C'mon bring it to me, cuz I'm always gonna be unbreakable
Reliable, undeniable
Come on give it to me, cuz I'm always gonna be unbreakable
Don't need the diamond cards or cold cash
Don't need to sell my soul so don't ask
Took a pass on the bass I'd be leaving right now
Newsflash, I'm causing a commotion
Jump back, I'm poetry in motion,
Think fast, talk trash
Well I ain't talking back but I'm calling you out
No time for fussing and fighting
Lived through the screaming and the lying
I'm fine, you can't deny
I'm unbreakable
Unstoppable
I'm invincible
You're gonna bring it to me
I'm unbreakable, unstoppable, I'm invincible
C'mon bring it to me, cuz I'm always gonna be unbreakable
Reliable, undeniable
Come on give it to me, cuz I'm always gonna be unbreakable
Newsflash, I'm causing a commotion
Jump back, I'm poetry in motion,
I'm fine, you can't deny
I'm unbreakable, unstoppable, I'm invincible
C'mon bring it to me, cuz I'm always gonna be unbreakable
Reliable, undeniable
Come on give it to me, cuz I'm always gonna be unbreakable
Unstoppable, I'm invincible, you're gonna bring it to me
Cuz I'm always gonna be unbreakable
Reliable, undeniable
Come on give it to me, cuz I'm always gonna be unbreakable
I will be unbreakable, unbreakable, I will be unbreakable
**These Open Arms
What if everything you always took for granted, was gone?
And everything you ever thought was right, was wrong?
And what if everyone you ever loved was torn, from the pages of your life?
Would you reach out for tomorrow, or try to turn back time?
These open arms will wait for you
These open arms can pull us through
Between what's left and left to do
These open arms
These open arms
These open arms will wait for you
Did you really love the ones you said you loved, that's right?
And did you make a damn of difference in somebody else's life?
Tell me, is there someone you can count on when you need a friend?
Can you say I need a friend?
These open arms will wait for you
These open arms can pull us through
Between whats left and left to do
These open arms
These open arms
These open arms will wait for you
Can you live in your skin, walk in your own shoes?
You can't win, if you don't know how to lose
Crawl, fall, Jonny gotta learn to fly
These open arms will wait for you
These open arms can pull us through
Between what's left and left to do
These open arms
These open arms
These open arms
These open arms
These open arms will wait for you
**Lost Highway
In my rearview mirror
My life is getting clearer
The sunset sighs and slowly disappears
These trinkets once were treasure
Life changes like the weather
You grow up, grow old or hit the road 'round here
So I drive, watching white lines passing by
With my plastic dashboard Jesus, waiting there to greet us
Hey, hey, I finally found my way
Say goodbye to yesterday
Hit the gas there ain't no brakes on the lost highway
Yeah I'm busting loose, I'm letting go
Out on this open road
It's independence day on this lost highway
I don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
Now I'm afraid of going back again
So I drive, years and miles are flying by
And waiting there to great us
Is my plastic dashboard Jesus
Oh patron saint of lonely souls
To tell this boy which way to go
Guide the car, you got the keys
Farewell to mediocrity
Kicking off the cruise-control
And turning up the radio
Got just enough religion
And a half tank of gas come on, let's go 
I finally found my way
Say goodbye to yesterday
Hit the gas there ain't no brakes on the lost highway
Yeah I'm busting loose, I'm letting go
Out on this open road
It's independence day on this lost highway
**Summertime
Feels something like summertime
Top down ain't nothing but time
Radio's on and you're by my side
Feels something like summertime
These days life goes like this
Wake up, check that off of some list
Gotta be a little something more than this
at the bottom of my coffee cup
I keep a postcard in the back of my mind
White sand, sunshine
And you're shining like a brand new dime
That's keeping me from giving up
Thinking like I had enough
You make me feel something like summertime
Top down ain't nothing but time
Radio's on and you're by my side
Feels something like summertime
Like that first slow dance and that first long kiss
There ain't nothing baby better then this
It's like a beach blanket and a bottle of wine
It feels something like summertime
Summertime
I was a warm breeze with a cool tan
Life mapped out on the back of my hand
When I was laughing I was making plans
But I didn't laugh when I found you
If there's a heaven baby you're the proof
You make me feel something like summertime
Top down ain't nothing but time
Radio's on and you're by my side
Feels something like summertime
Like that first slow dance and that first long kiss
There ain't nothing baby better then this
It's like a beach blanket and a bottle of wine
It feels something like summertime
Summertime
[Solo]
Feel something like summertime
Top down ain't nothing but time
Radio's on for me and my valentine
Like that first slow dance and that first long kiss
There ain't nothing baby better then this
It's like a beach blanket and a bottle of wine (yeah)
Feels something like summertime
Top down ain't nothing but time
Radio's on and you're by my side,
Feels something like summertime
Just like summer time
Summertime
Something like summertime
**(You Want To) Make A Memory
Hello again, it’s you and me
Kinda always like it used to be
Sippin' wine, killing time
Trying to solve life’s mysteries.
How’s your life, it’s been a while
God it’s good to see you smile
I see you reaching for your keys
Looking for a reason not to leave.
If you don’t know if you should stay
If you don’t say what’s on your mind
Baby just, breathe there’s no where else tonight we should be-
You wanna make a memory.
I dug up this old photograph
Look at all that hair we had
It’s bittersweet to hear you laugh
Your phone is ringing, I don’t wanna ask.
If you go now, I’ll understand
If you stay, hey, I got a plan
You wanna make a memory
You wanna steal a piece of time
You could sing a melody to me 
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory.
If you don’t know if you should stay
And you don’t say what’s on your mind
Baby just, breathe there’s no where else tonight we should be-
You wanna make a memory
You wanna steal a piece of time
You could sing a melody to me 
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory
You wanna make a memory
**Whole Lot Of Leavin'
It's pretty cold for late September
And autumn wind is creepin' in
The summer sun packed up it's long gone
There's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on
Yeah!
I bet it's warm in California
I think it's time to hit the road
I just might call that plain of gypsies
Whose searching for our pot of gold
Seems like lately there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on
I close my eyes and picture your hand in mine
I still hear your voice that takes me back to that time
Where I can find a reason to be strong
Seems like lately there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on
Close the window draw the curtains
You ain't the only one here hurt
No one's right no one's wrong
Lately there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on
I close my eyes and picture your hand in mine
I still hear your voice that takes me back to that time
Where I can find a reason to be strong
Seems like lately there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on
You used to live to say you love me
Now you got one foot of the door
It's then you turn around and ask me
Do we got it anymore
I close my eyes and picture your hand in mine
I still hear your voice that takes me back to that time
Where I need find a reason to be strong
I close my eyes and picture your hand in mine
Yeah I hold the line you'll never hear me say goodbye
So pretty thing let the years be strong
Seems like lately there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on
I'll come back for you baby
**We Got It Going On
Is there anybody out there looking for a party?
Shake your money maker, baby smoke it if you got it.
We just wanna have some fun if you don't wanna kiss this
Everybody raise your hands come on I need a witness.
We got it goin' on
We'll be banging and singing just like the Rolling Stones

**Any Other Day
Alarm clock rings, it's 6:45,
Must have hit that snooze button least 3 times,
Wishing this morning was still last night,
On any other day, just might wanna die.
Traffics backed up 20 miles to the east,
Must have hit every damn red light on the street,
Weatherman says "It's gonna rain for a week"
Hey, what can you do?
[CHORUS:]
On any other day, I'd be blue eyes cryin',
I could tell the world, 'At least I'm tryin',
The clouds are breakin',
The sun is shinin' new for me and you.
On any other day, I would just go crazy,
the grace is knowing that you're gonna save me,
Baby luck and love,
Will pull us through?
On any other day
Yeah, Yeah!
On any other day, I might just stay in bed
Sit down in a sea of blankets
Pull them up over my head
Get your papers in the morning
Just to get a little edge
Then maybe just give up in time to do it all again
Hey, I like where this is going
Yeah, 'cause I know where it's been
[CHORUS]
[SOLO]
Alarm clock rings, it's 6:45,
I like waking up with you on my mind
Knowing that you're saving me
One more time.
On any other day, I would just go crazy,
the grace is knowing that you're gonna save me,
Baby luck and love,
Will pull us through?
On any other day
Yeah, Yeah!
**Seat Next To You
Long slow drive down an old dirt road
You've got your hand out the window, listening to the radio
That's where I wanna be...
On an old park bench in the middle of December
Cold hard rain fallin', can't find no cover
That would be alright with me...
Hard days, good times, blue skies, dark nights
Baby, I want you to take me ... wherever you're going to
Maybe say that you'll save me ... a seat next to you
In the corner booth of a downtown bar, with your head on my shoulder
Smokin' on a cheap cigar...that would be alright with me
In the back row of a movie or a cross-town train
I wanna hear your voice whispering my name...that's where I wanna be
Hard days, good times, blue skies, dark nights
Baby, say that you'll take me ... wherever you're going to
Maybe say that you'll save me ... a seat next to you
Life is like a ferris wheel, spinnin' around
When you get to the top it's hard to look down
Just hang on ... we'll make it through
Save me ... a seat next to you
When you get to the gates and the angels sing
Go to that place where the church bells ring
You know I'll come runnin' ... runnin' to find you
Baby, say that you'll take me ... wherever you're going to
Maybe I want you to save me ... a seat next to you
A seat next to you
A seat ... next to you
A seat ... next to you
**Everybody's Broken
Welcome to the party
Come on in and disappear
You're feeling like a stranger
But all your friends are here
Little lines and cracks
Around your eyes and mouth
Something's trying to get in
Something's trying to get out
It's ok, to be a little broken
Everybody's broken, in this life
It's ok, to feel a little broken
Everybody's broken, your alright
It's just life
Step into the deep end
Make yourself at home
When you wonder why your breathing
Know your not alone
It's so hard to believe
It's easier to doubt
You're trying to hold in
But your dying to scream out
It's ok to be a little broken
Everybody's broken
In this life
It's ok to feel a little broken
Everybody's broken, your alright
It's alright, it's just life
[Solo]
Take a look around
Tell me what you see
Is who you think you are
Who you want to be
It's ok, to be a little broken
Everybody's broken, in this life
It's ok, to feel a little broken
Everybody's broken, your alright
Just keep on going
Eyes wide open
Everybody's broken
Everybody's broken
Everybody's broken
Everybody's broken
Everybody's broken
Everybody's broken
Yeah
**Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore
It might be hard to be lovers
But it's harder to be friends
Baby, pull down the covers
It's time you let me in
Maybe light a couple candles
I'll just go ahead and lock the door
If you just talk to me baby
Till we ain't strangers anymore
Lay your head on my pillow
I sit beside you on the bed
Don't you think its time we say
Some things we haven't said
It ain't too late to get back to that place
Back to where, we thought it was before
Why don't you look at me
Till we ain't strangers anymore
Sometimes it's hard to love me
Sometimes it's hard to love you too
I know it's hard believing
That love can pull us through
It would be so easy
To live your life
With one foot out the door
Just hold me baby
Till we ain't strangers anymore
[Solo]
It's hard to find forgiveness
When we just turn out the light
It's hard to say you're sorry
When you can't tell wrong from right
It would be so easy
To spend your whole damn life
Just keeping score
So let's get down to it baby
There ain't no need to lie
Tell me who you think you see
When you look into my eyes
Lets put our two hearts back together
And we'll leave the broken pieces on the floor
Make love with me baby
Till we ain't strangers anymore
We're not strangers anymore
We're not strangers
We're not strangers anymore
**The Last Night
These days, its hard to have a heart
It doesn't matter where you come from, or who you think you are
These days, it's hard just fitting in
Why does someone have to lose, for someone else to win
We're all looking for forgiveness, and someone we can trust
You can wrap your arms around the world
It all comes down to us
This is the last night, you'll have to be alone
I'll be standing right beside you, you can't make it on your own
So walk with me, please, help me to be strong
I'll be the shoulder you can lean on, when everybody's gone
This is the last night, you'll have to be alone
I know, you, heard it all before
There's nothing worst than living less
When you yearn for something more
Makes no sense, its hard to understand
When there's something that should fill you up
Keeps slipping through your hands
We're all looking for answers
We're all down here on our knees
All anybody really wants, is something to believe
Enough is enough, I can't take any more
But I'm standing on your front porch
Kicking down your door
This is the last night
This is the last night
**One Step Closer
I've seen the heart of darkness
Let's just say I crossed over that line
Held hands with the hopeless
In too deep on that ride
Went around one more time
When you're standing on the edge
You don't look down
Till you're ready and willing to fly
Now I'm one step closer
With my arms open wide
I'm one step closer
And I'm willing to try this time
I hitched a ride with forgiveness
In that river of emotion
I went down a third time
I spent the night with the living
Took a chance looked inside
Didn't know who I'd find
Standing on the corner of hello and goodbye
All alone it's there I made up my mind
I'm one step closer
With my arms open wide
I'm one step closer
And I'm willing and to try 
I'm sick of giving up
With a little luck
I'm gonna get out of here
When you're standing on the edge
You don't look down
Till you're ready and willing to fly
Now I'm one step closer
With my arms open wide
I'm one step closer
And I'm willing to try
I'm one step closer
I'm one step closer
**I Love This Town
I always knew, that I'd like this place
You don't have to look too far, to find a friendly face
I feel alive when I'm walkin' on the street
I feel the heart of the city poundin' underneath my feet
[CHORUS]
Yeah let the world keep spinning round 'n' round
This is where it's goin' down, down, down
That's why I, love this town
That's why I, keep co-min' round
Say hey (say hey) say yeah (say yeah)
You make me feel at home some how, right, now
That's why I, love this town
I've got some good friends here, I might have broke a heart or two
It's gettin' loud over there, they boys must have had a few
And hey the cop on the corner, he knows everybody's name
And a kid with a dream singin' for some spare loose change
[CHORUS]
Yeah let the world keep spinning round 'n' round
This is where it's goin' down, down, down
That's why I, love this town
That's why I, keep co-min' round
Say hey (say hey) say yeah (say yeah)
You make me feel at home some how, right, now
That's why I, love this town
[GUITAR SOLO]
There's shoutin' from the rooftops
Dancin' on the bars
Hangin' out the window
Drivin' in their famous cars
You want it? You got it
You ready? I'm on it
Come on now, here we go again....
That's why I, love this town
That's why I, love this town
No matter where you're from, tonight you're from right here
This is where it all goes down, down, down
That's why I, love this town
[REPEAT x3]
Say hey (say hey) say yeah (say yeah)
I love this town
[END REPEAT]
Say hey (say hey) say yeah (say yeah)
I loove this town
[GUITAR SOLO - END OF SONG]
**We Weren't Born To Follow
This one goes out to the man who mines for miracles
This one goes out to the ones in need
This one goes out to the sinner and the cynical
This ain't about no apology
This road was paved by the hopeless and the hungry
This road was paved by the winds of change
Walking beside the guilty and the innocent
How will you raise your hand when they call your name?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We weren't born to follow
Come on and get up off your knees
When life is a bitter pill to swallow
You gotta hold on to what you believe
Believe that the sun will shine tomorrow
And that your saints and sinners bleed
We weren't born to follow
You gotta stand up for what you believe
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
This one's about anyone who does it differently
This one's about the one who cusses and spits
This ain't about our livin' in a fantasy
This ain't about givin' up or givin' in
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We weren't born to follow
Come on and get up off your knees
When life is a bitter pill to swallow
You gotta hold on to what you believe
Believe that the sun will shine tomorrow
And that your saints and sinners bleed
We weren't born to follow
You gotta stand up for what you believe
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah

We weren't born to follow
Come on and get up off your knees
When life is a bitter pill to swallow

You gotta stand up for what you believe
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah

**When We Were Beautiful
The world is cracked
The sky is torn
I’m hanging in
You’re holding on
I can’t pretend
That nothings changed
Living in the shadows
Of the love we made
Back…When we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Back… When we were innocent
I wonder where it went
Let’s go back and find it
Sha la la Sha la la hey Sha la la 
Sha la la Sha la la hey Sha la la
Some dreams live 
Some will die
But the you and me
Is still alive 
Now am I blessed?
Or am I cursed?
Cause the way we are
Aint the way we were
Back…When we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Back… When we were innocent
I wonder where it went
Let’s go back and find it

The world is cracked
The sky is torn
So much less
Meant so much more
Back…When we were beautiful
Before the world got small

Back…When we were beautiful
Back…When we were beautiful

**Work For The Working Man
I'm here trying to make a living
I ain't living just to die
Never getting back what I'm giving
Can someone somewhere help me justify
Why these strong hands are on the un-employment line
Now there's nothing left
But what's on my mind
oh ohh oh ohh
Who's gonna work for the working man
(Hurt) for the working man
(Work) Get your hands in the dirt
Who's gonna work off the curse
(Work) Brother I'll be damned
(Work) If I don't raise a hand
(Work) Whose gonna work work work 
For the working man, working man
Empty pockets full of worry
Had to get two jobs
And it was hard enough just getting by
With the grace of god I'll get us through
I only know what I know how to do
I'm the only one who's got to look my family in the eye
Day after day
Night after night
Oh Ohh Oh Ohh
Who's gonna work for the working man
(Hurt) for the working man
(Work) Get your hands in the dirt
Who's gonna work off the curse
(Work) Brother I'll be damned
(Work) If I don't raise a hand
(Work) Whose gonna work work work 
For the working man, working man, working man, working man
I lost my pension
They took my I.D
These were my friends
These were my dreams
These were my hopes
These are my streets
Can you hear me?
Who's gonna work for the working man
(Hurt) for the working man
(Work) Get your hands in the dirt
Who's gonna work off the curse
(Work) Brother I'll be damned
(Work) If I don't raise a hand
(Work) Whose gonna work work work 
For the working man, working man, working man, working man
These were my friens
These were my dreams
These were my hopes
These are my... streets
**Superman Tonight
There's something about you
I want to rescue
I don't even know you
So what does that mean
Maybe I'm cynical
I'm painfully logical
You're tragic and beautiful
And that's good enough for me
You're looking for a hero, but it's just my old tattoo
Tonight I swear I'd sell my soul to be a hero for you
Who's going to save you
When the stars fall from your sky
And who's going to pull you in
When the tide gets too high
Who's going to hold you
When you turn out the lights
I won't lie I wish that I
Could be your superman tonight
If somebody sent you
An angel to save you
What would you tell him to turn him away
That your heart don't break
That your lips don't kiss
That life is just a lie
That heaven don't exist?
Who's going to save you
When the stars fall from your sky
And who's going to pull you in
When the tide gets too high
Who's going to hold you
When you turn out the lights
I won't lie I wish that I
Could be your superman tonight
Who's going to fix you
The next time you break down
Stranded alone by the side of the road
It's your baggage that's dragging you down
Don't look back
Let it go
Ohhh, Ohhhhh
Who's going to save you
When the stars fall from your sky
And who's going to pull you in
When the tide gets too high
Who's going to hold you
When you turn out the lights
I won't lie I wish that I
Was that superman
Who's going to save you
When the stars fall from your sky
And who's going to pull you in
When the tide gets too high
Who's going to hold you
When you turn out the lights
I won't lie I wish that I
Could be your superman tonight
woooah, woooah, woooah ohhh
woooah, woooah, woooah ohhh
woooah, woooah, woooah ohhh
woooah, woooah, woooah ohhh
**Bullet
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah
Dateline early sunday morning
Shots ring out without a warning
No one seems to even blink in this town
Two dead and a baby missing
Sirens screaming in the distance
A mother pleading bring my baby home now
For the pink slip of an suv
A night cut down with tragedy
His defense another generation breakdown
Yeah, Yeah
What is the distance between a bullet and a gun
God are you listning
Or have you just given up
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Corporate countries go to war
Behind the lies they're fighting for
And black gold from an old king's soul won his round
How can someone take a life
In the name of god and say it's right
How does money lead to greed
When there's still hungry mouths to feed
Yeah, Yeah 
What is the distance between a bullet and a gun
God are you listning
Or have you just given up
We need forgiveness
We all need a lot of love....
We need some hope
We need it now
A little faith man help me out
I'll learn to pray
But it's too late now
Yeah, Yeah
What is the distance between a bullet and a gun
God are you listening
Or have you just given up
What is the distance between a bullet and a gun
We need forgivness
We all need a lot of love...
A lot of love...
**Thorn In My Side
Thorn in my side
You're always there
Just to remind me
That I still care
Thorn in my side
You won't let me go
Right there beside me
To let me know
I've been pushed around
Been knocked down
Lost a round or three
Life took a couple of things I loved
When I was too blind to see
But I'll survive
I gave up on luck but I'm still getting by
Yeah I'm going to be alright
You can test my faith
But you can't take my pride
Thorn in my side, thorn in my side, ooooah
Thorn in my side
You just won't quit
Once in a while when I crack a smile
You rub my face in it
Thorn in my side
You won't let me run
God bless the fights
That I've lost and won
But I'll survive
I gave up on luck but I'm still getting by
Yeah I'm going to be alright
You can test my faith
But you can't take my pride
Thorn in my side, thorn in my side, thorn in my side
Thorn in my side, thorn in my side, thorn in my side
I've been pushed around
Been knocked down
Lost a round or three
Life took a couple of things I loved
When I was too blind to see
But I'll survive
I gave up on luck but I'm still getting by
Yeah I'm going to be alright
You can test my faith
But you can't take my pride
Thorn in my side, thorn in my side, thorn in my side
Thorn in my side, thorn in my side, thorn in my side
Thorn in my side, wooah, wooooahh ohhh
wooah oh oh, woooah oh ohhhh
**Live Before You Die
I was a little boy of 9 years old
The whole world in my hands
Trying to toss that ball across the yard
A game of catch with my old man
He would always say I'm sorry
Every time he had to leave
And I was much to young to understand
When he would say to me
When you're young you always think
The sun is going to shine
There will come a day
When you have to say hello to goodbye
Sit down son take my hand,
Look me in the eye
Take these words, promise me
You'll live before you die
I was barely seventeen summer of seventy-nine
Already I was feeling like I was running out of time
I had this girl we fell in love
Or should I say that she had me
Then one fateful night changed our lives
And made a memory
When you're young you always think
The sun is going to shine
There will come a day
When you have to say hello to goodbye
She laid me down she took my hand
And looked me in the eye
And just before she kissed me she said
You got to live before we die
You learn to love to live
You fight and you forgive
You learn what's wrong and right
You live before you die
I made mistakes I caught some breaks
But I got not regrets
There's some things I don't remember
But one thing I don't forget
When you're young you always think
The sun is going to shine
One day you're going to have to say hello to goodbye
Shout it out let someone somewhere
Know that you're alive
Take these words wear them well
Live before you die
Live before you die
Hey!
Live before you die
You learn to love to live
You fight and you forgive
You face the darkest night
Just live before you die
**Brokenpromiseland
Angels falling from the sky
Imagine that imaine that
Nobody getting out of here alive
No turning back no turning back
Who's going to bail out all our shattered dreams
And scrape some truth off of these city streets
No time for praying get up off your knees
There's hope I know
Out on that lonely road
Cause home is where you are and where I am
Breathe in breathe out
There's only now
And all I got I'm holding in my hands
We're breaking out of brokepromiseland
Let's close our eyes and just disappear
Slip through the cracks no looking back
We'll get a million miles away from here
And let the past just fade to black
So what you learn to live with your regrets
No need to fear what hasn't happened yet
Life will get you but you can't forget
There's hope I know
Out on that lonely road
Cause home is where you are and where I am
Breathe in breathe out
There's only now
And all I got I'm holding in my hands
We're breaking out of brokepromiseland
So rise my fallen angel
Come on now come on now
Shine, don't let them break you
Come on now, come on now
Come on now, come on now
Come on now, come on now
Come on now, come on
There's hope I know
Out on that lonely road
Cause home is where you are and where I am
Breathe in breathe out
There's only now
And all I got I'm holding in my hands
We're breaking out of brokepromiseland
La la la la la la la la... breaking out of brokenpromiseland
La la la la la la la la... breaking out of brokenpromiseland
La la la la la la la la, La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la, La la la la la la la la
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh
**Love's The Only Rule
I don't give a damn 
How it's supposed to be
That might work for you
It don't work for me
You write your truth 
And I'll write mine
One man's ceiling's 
Another man's sky high
Flying like an aeroplane
Crying Like the lonely whistle of a long black train
Dance in the pouring rain
Spit in the eye of a hurricane
Who said life has got to be so cruel
Love's the only rule
It's written in the scars
Where I fit in
It's going to hurt sometimes 
You got to lose to win
You've got your sins 
And I got mine
Sell your secrets kiss them all goodbye
Flying like an aeroplane
Alive like a lonely note from John Coltrane
Run like it's a getaway
Say those things that you shouldn't say
Think about it wouldn't that be cool?
If love's the only rule
Might be a wrecking ball
Or just a wake up call
Don't matter where the peices fall
Wooooah, wooooah, wooooah
I'm gonna fly like an aeroplane
Cry like the whistle of a long black train
Dance in the pouring rain
I'm alive like a lonely not from John Coltrane
Run like it's a getaway
Say those things that you souldn't say
Where love, love's the only rules
Yes love, love's the only rule
Ah love, love's the only rule
Love, only rule
Love's the only rule
Wooooah, wooooah , wooooah
**Fast Cars
How can I defend
"Let's live for now not then"
We're chasing tail lights
Let them fade into the distance
Let's say the engine stalled and start again
Turn around let's turn around
It's a dark road we been heading down
Trust me tonight I swear I know where we are
We're gonna run all the lights
We're gonna blow right through the radar
Fast cars
We are fast cars
How can I pretend the signs don't say dead end
So many hearts just wind up in a junkyard
Where memories are nothing but spare parts
Turn around just turn around
And leave the past behind us now
Come on we aint gonna crash
This time we ain't slowing down
we'll pull ahed of the pack
Slip thru the cracks cause we are
Fast cars
On a long ride take your foot off the brake
Let's just put it in drive
We are fast cars on the inside
There's no turning back
On the highway of life
Fast cars
We are fast cars
(Sha La Sha La)
Flying through the stop signs
(Sha La Sha La)
Running over bad times
(Sha La Sha La)
Gunning down the daylight
Counting days like white lines
Holding on for our lives
We are fast cars
We are fast cars
On a long ride take your foot off the brake
Let's just put it in drive
We are fast cars on the inside
There's no turning back on this highway tonight
(Sha La Sha La)
(Sha La Sha La)
We are fast cars
(Sha La Sha La)
We are fast cars
We are fast cars
Happy Now
What would you say to me
If I told you I had a dream
If I told you everything
Would you tell me to go back to sleep
Take a look in these tired eyes
They're coming back to life
I know I can change
Got hope in my veins
I'm telling you I ain't going back to the pain
Can I be happy now
Can I let my breath out
Let me believe
I'm building a dream
Don't try to drag me down
I just want to scream out loud
Can I be happy now
Been down on my knees
I learned how to bleed
I'm turnin my world around
Can I be happy now
Can I break free somehow
I just want to live again
Love again
Pick my pride up off of the ground
I'm ready to pick a fight
Crawl out of the dark to shine a light
I ain't throwing stones
Got sins of my own
Ain't everbody just trying to find a way home
Can I be happy now
Can I let my breath out
let me believe
I'm building a dream
Don't try to drag me down
I just want to scream out loud
Can I be happy now
Been down on my knees
I learned how to bleed
I'm turning my world around
You're born then you die
it's all gone in a minute
I ain't looking back
Cause I don't want to miss it
You better live now
Cause no one's going to get out alive, alive
Can I be happy now
Can I let my breath out
let me believe
I'm building a dream
Don't try to drag me down
I just want to scream out loud
Can I be happy now
Been down on my knees
I learned how to bleed
I'm turning my world around
Can I be happy now
Ohhhh
I'm turning my world around
Can I be happy now
**Learn To Love
I have run from the truth
Since the days of my misspent youth
I was hungry for kindness
I was lost in life's blindness
When you're born without wings
All you dream of all you want
Is that feeling of flying?
Of rising and climbing
Halle Halle
We're one breath away
Halle Halle
From our judgement day
You leave it all on the table
If you lose or you win
You've got to learn to love
The world you're living in
Always thought I'd die young
In these hands I held the gun
But it's too late for dying
Now there's nothing worth hiding
I've lost love lived with shame
I was humbled by my fall from grace
On the steps of decision
It's revenge or forgiveness
Halle Halle
We're one breath away
Halle Halle
From our judgement day
You leave it all on the table
If you lose or you win
You got to learn to love
The world you're living in
Halle Halle
Halle Halle
Halle Halle
We're one breath away
Halle Halle
From our judgement day
You leave it all on the table
If you lose or you win
You got to learn to love
The world you're living in
Halle Halle
And that's how it is
You've got to learn to love
The world you're living in
Halle Halle
Halle Halle
Halle Halle
**Because We Can
I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can
She's in the kitchen staring out the window
So tired of living life in black and white
Right now she's missing those technicolor kisses
When he turns down the lights
Lately he's feeling like a broken promise
In the mirror staring down his doubt
There's only one thing in this world that he knows
He said forever and he'll never let her down
I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can
TV and takeout on the coffee table
Paper dishes, pour a glass of wine
Turn down the sound and move a little closer
And for the moment everything is alright
I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can, our love can move a mountain
We can, if you believe in we
We can, just wrap your arms around me
We can, we can
I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can, our love can move a mountain
We can, if you believe in we
We can, just wrap your arms around me
We can, we can
Because we can
**I'm With You
Look at this world
It's filled with worn out faces
Forgotten places and nothing changes
Whatever happened to that new day rising
We're just surviving when living is dying
Aren't you tired of being let down?
Another day, another shakedown
I'm with you
When hope is gone and all you want is the truth
(I'm with you)
You carry on when they say, "It's no use"
(I'm with you)
If I got one thing, I got something to prove
We all got nothing if there's nothing to lose
(I'm with you)
I walk in shadows that seem all familiar
I've read the papers, life forsaken
A vacant store front, I want more for sale sign
Down on main street you just walk by
How many times we gotta break down
Before somebody's gonna shout out?
I'm with you
When hope is gone and all you want is the truth
(I'm with you)
You carry on when they say, "It's no use"
(I'm with you)
If I got one thing, I got something to prove
We all got nothing if there's nothing to lose
(I'm with you)
[Guitar Solo]
When hope is gone and all you want is the truth
(I'm with you)
You carry on when they say, "It's no use" (you say, "It's no use")
Well, I've got one thing, I got something to prove
We all got nothing if there's nothing to lose
(I'm with you)
I'm with you.
I'm with you.
I'm with you.
**What About Now
You wanna start a fire
It only takes a spark
You gotta get behind the wheel
If you're ever gonna drive that car
If you wanna take a bite
You'd better have the teeth
If you're gonna take that step
Then get up off of your knees
'Cause tonight we're alive
Who'll stand for the restless and the lonely?
For the desperate and the hungry?
Time for the count, I'm hearing you now.
For the faithful, the believer,
For the faithless and the teacher.
Stand up and be proud...
What about now?
You wanna start a fight
You gotta take a swing.
You gotta get your hands in the dirt
To see what the harvest will bring.
You wanna raise your voice
Don't be scared to breathe
Don't be afraid to hurt
Don't be ashamed in need
'Cause tonight we're alive
Who'll stand for the restless and the lonely?
For the desperate and the hungry?
Time for the count, I'm hearing you now.
For the faithful, the believer,
For the faithless and the teacher.
Stand up and be proud...
What about now?
The leaves fall like reasons that drift through the seasons
'Til dreams are just fade dark and grey.
And all of your plans that slip right through your hands
Are just things that you take to your grave.
Tonight we're alive.
Who'll stand for the restless, for the lonely?
For the desperate and the hungry?
Time for the count, I'm hearing you now.
For the faithful, the believer,
For the faithless and the teacher.
Stand up and be proud...
What about now?
What about now?
What about now?
What about now?
**Pictures Of You
I feel just like Picasso
And you're my masterpiece
I painted you a lifetime
Now what's left are memories
Oooh
Sunlight's in the curtains
Diamonds in the trees
I gave you colors blue and gold
As you lay upon the sheets
Something so familiar drawn from this blank page
Every line from my hand takes me back to what I can't erase
No matter how I try, no matter what I do
I'm still painting pictures of you
I could almost smell your perfume
In each brush stroke of the flowers
I left you tea from China
Waiting in your sacred tower
Something so familiar drawn from this blank page
Every line from my hand takes me back to what I can't erase
No matter how I try, no matter what I do
I'm still painting pictures of you
If I should go crazy, if I would go blind
I'd still fill the canvas from the pictures in my mind
If that's the only way to make you mine
It was something so familiar
Drawn from this blank page
Every line from my hand takes me back to what I can't erase
No matter how I try, no matter what I do
I'm still painting pictures, I'm always painting pictures
Still painting pictures of you
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh...
**Amen
Last night I had a dream
The dream I had was true
I fell through the stars
When walking on the moon
Burned like a thousand candles in her arms
Her skin under my finger tips
The honeysuckle on her lips
Sweeter than a man deserves to taste
Mercy, mercy, what else can I say?
But amen, amen, amen
Last night we were born together
It was like we’d always been
She’ll be with me forever
If I don’t see her again
We poured the wine until our cup ran over
Unfolding like a mystery
Inside of her like poetry
A thousand horses running through my veins
Mercy, mercy what else can I say
Amen, amen, amen
I laid down in her garden
Naked on her floor
Windows up, the curtains blowing
She don’t lock the door
Amen, amen
At the banquet table
A beggar at a feast
I felt her tongue between my lips
And I forgot to breath
We stayed there ‘til the candles burned the carpet
Last night I had a dream
The dream I had was true
Mercy, mercy, what else can I say
Mercy, mercy, I kneeled down and prayed
Amen, amen, amen
**That's What The Water Made Me
Baby, baby, baby
There's no use in trying to save me
There's devils in heaven
There's angels in hell
So, blow me one last kiss
And wish me well, well
Love is like fingerprints
They don't wash away
I left mine all over you
I take the blame
Ask me how
Ask me what
Ask me why, baby
That's what the water made me
That's who I am and what I'll be
That's what the water, that's what the water made me
There ain't no doubt about it
It makes you or brings you to your knees
That's what the water, that's what the water made me
This world is cracked and crazy
Say one of your pretty prayers for me
No rose in the garden
Or wish in the well
I don't know how
Don't know what
Don't know why, baby
That's what the water made me
That's who I am and what I'll be
That's what the water, that's what the water made me
There ain't no doubt about it
It makes you or brings you to your knees
That's what the water, that's what the water made me
That's what the water, that's what the water
Ask me how
Ask me what
Ask me why
Baby, baby, baby
There's no use in trying to save me
There's devils in heaven
There's angels in hell
(Hold me close, hold me close, hold me)
That's what the water made me
That's who I am and what I'll be
That's what the water, that's what the water made me
There ain't no doubt about it
It makes you or brings you to your knees
That's what the water, that's what the water
**What's Left Of Me
For thirty odd years I was a newspaper man
I made my living with a pen and a pad
God I miss the smell of paper and the ink on my hands
Been back from the desert for a year or so
I left more in that sand than you'll ever know
Another war was waiting for me when I got back home
In the name of the flag some gave their lives
I'm still living, yeah, Semper Fi
Well, that's my story, what else can I say
Hey, hey
I got a lot to give say can you see
I'm still breathing and my heart still beats
They took the car but they left the lease
Does anybody want what's left of me?
Boarded up the house, they left the keys
Foreclosed on my city, rolled up these streets
But I ain't checking out, I still got my dreams
Does anybody want what's left of me?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
They called us "Dirty Harry", we're a punk rock band
Why they sold old CBGB's I don't understand
All that’s left now are the t-shirts and they come from Japan
I sold my drums to make ends meet
The band broke up, we had to eat
It's the same old shit, it just happens more these days,
Hey, hey
I got a lot to give say can you see
I'm still breathing and my heart still beats
They took the car but they left the lease
Does anybody want what's left of me?
Boarded up the house, they left the keys
Foreclosed on my city, rolled up these streets
But I ain't checking out, I still got my dreams
Does anybody want what's left of me?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I'm a teacher, I'm a farmer, I'm a union man
It's getting hard to make a living in this hard land
We ain't working in our factories, all those jobs went overseas.
Hey, hey.
Does anybody want, does anybody want,
Does anybody want what's left of me?
I got a lot to give, say can you see
I'm still breathing and my heart still beats
They took the car but they left the lease
Does anybody want what's left of me?
Does anybody want to buy or rent,
Take a chance or place a bet?
I ain't checking out, I still got my dreams
Does anybody want what's left of me?
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Does anybody want, does anybody want,
Does anybody want what's left of me?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Does anybody want, does anybody want,
Does anybody want what's left of me?
**Army Of One
I’m in this war
But got no gun
Still standing strong
An army of one
So sign me up
I’m a soldier
I’ve got a voice
It’s all I need
A beating heart inside of me
I’m an army of one
I’m a soldier
These eyes hold no disguise
We’re fighting for our lives
We’re all trying to get back home tonight
Never give up
Never give up
Never
Never give up
Never let up
Ever
Never give in
You’re an army of one
Never give up
Never give up
Never
Never forget
Where you’re from
Never give up
You’re an army of one
I can’t hurt but I still feel
I know that life’s a battlefield
When the times get tough
I’m a soldier
And when it’s time to face the fight
With just my shadow at my side
I’m an army of one
I’m a soldier
Never give up
Never give up
Never
Never give up
Never let up
Ever
Never give in
You’re an army of one
Never give up
Never give up
Never
Never forget
Where you’re from
Never give up
You’re an army of one
So don't apologize
Defend, just be alive
We’re all trying
To get it right tonight
Never give up

Ever
Never give in
You’re an army of one
Never give up

Where you’re from
Never give up
You’re an army of one
**Thick As Thieves
In an empty room or a downtown bar
'Cross the universe, there's no place too far
Ya wherever you are, you and me
Thick as thieves
Well it ain't always pretty, sometimes it got rough
Could have thrown the towel in and thrown our hands up
Seems like we've always been and always will be
Thick as thieves
Time, time won't ever drag us down
You, me, us, ain't looking back or turning around
It's classic boy meets girl, with our backs against the world
You and me
Thick as thieves
In a world without faith, you're what I believe
When they're stacking the deck,
You're the card up my sleeve in my hour of need,
You and me, yeah
Thick as thieves
And that are all that's left behind us now
You, me, us, ain't looking back or turning around
It's classic boy meets girl, with our backs against the world
You and me
Thick as thieves
If I robbed a bank you wouldn't care
You'd come sit on my lap in the electric chair
And when they flipped the switch, huh, we'd just kiss
I know nothing's gonna stop us now
You, me, us, on the edge and never looking down
What's a boy to do, it's classic me and you
Lucky you, lucky me
Thick as thieves, oooh
Thick as thieves, woah, woah.
**The Beautiful World
Every day it's the same when they say that it might be the end
In the end when it ends then I'll listen to them
You wake up, go to work, go to sleep
Then you do it, you do it, if you're lucky then you do it again
Yeah, we walk through a world that we don't understand
When I look in your eyes I'm just happy I can
Yeah, we'll laugh and we'll cry and we'll lose and we'll win
We'll get through it and to prove it yeah we'll do it again
There's glory in the saddest story
Look at it, just sticks and bricks
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit
Where we're going, where we've been
This ain't paradise we're living in
It's a diamond, it's a dirty plastic pearl
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world?
It's a shame when they say that it's been done and said
They keep digging that grave, let them bury their heads
There's a kid with a dream and a sky full of stars
There's another first kiss in the back of some car
Turn a page and write the story
Look at it, just sticks and bricks
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit
Where we're going, where we've been
This ain't paradise we're living in
It's a diamond, it's a dirty plastic pearl
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world?
They're running numbers out of the Spanish grocery
Mary Mary says her rosary
We get a ladder, there's a cat up in a tree
Ah
The Pretzel man's wearing Gucci glasses
A widow spreads her lover's ashes
I'll hold on to you, hold on to me, yeah
We'll do it, we'll do it, yeah, we're lucky then we'll do it again
Ah
Look at it, just sticks and bricks
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit
Where we're going, where we've been
This ain't paradise we're living in
It's a diamond, it's a dirty string of pearl.
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world?
Oh, ain't it a beautiful world?
Oh, oh, ain't it a beautiful world?
**Room At The End Of The World
There's a room at the end of the world
Where my secrets go to hide
There's a room at the end of the world
Where I'll wait for you tonight
Where the roads all go to end
Where lost Valentines get sent
Where a rose comes back to life
Where young love never dies
Where we never say goodbye
Don't say no, just give in
Close your eyes, there's no sin
Don't hold back, just let go
Take your time, take it slow
It's me and you in our room at the end of the world
There's a room at the end of the world
Where your memories are safe
There's a room at the end of the world
Just gotta have some faith
Where all prayers go to be heard and the truth will have its turn
Take a look into these eyes, there's no place I'd rather be tonight
No place I'd rather be tonight
Don't say no, just give in
Close your eyes, there's no sin
Don't hold back, just let go
Take your time, take it slow
It's me and you in our room at the end of the world
There's no looking back in our room
Fade to black
There's a room at the end of the world
That I hang on to
There's a room at the end of the world
Where I wait for you,
I'll wait for you
Don't say no, just give in
Close your eyes, there's no sin
Don't hold back, just let go
Take your time, take it slow
It's me and you in our room at the end of the world
Where I wait for you in our room
Dreams are coming true in our room
It's just me and you in our room.
**The Fighter
I should write down these words ‘fore I lose them
Or write you a song just to use them
Someday you may wanna know who I am, 
Beyond this facade no guitar in my hand
No I am not a writer
These eyes hold no secrets I hide no truths
I am all I am, all I was to you
The lie and the promise, the great escape artist,
The weed in your garden in that place you’re still guarding
Where I am not a liar
I am the fighter, though not a boxer by trade
I am the fighter, few will remember my name
These are hands that can offer protection
But hid me from my own reflection
I’m that book that ain’t finished, a sink full of dishes, 
The horse that ain’t winning, the priest that’s still sinning
The spark that starts the fire
I am the fighter, though not a boxer by trade
I am the fighter, few will remember my name
With loneliness next to me, feels its misery, nursing another black eye
On the New Jersey turnpike, counting the headlights
Those cars just like days pass me by
I am the fighter, though not a boxer by trade
I am the fighter, few will remember my name
I am the fighter, though not a boxer by trade
I am the fighter, a fighter’s born but not made
I should write down these words ‘fore I lose them
Or write you a song just to use them.
**With These Two Hands
I could roll the dice
And give you ten good reasons
I could break the ice
And pick up the broken pieces
I could wave hello, I could raise a glass,
I could blow a kiss, I could kick your ass
We could take it all apart or hold it all together
With these two hands I can tear down walls
I can build a bridge, I can break my fall
With these two hands I can pray or fight
I can hold the torch, I can shine a light
With these two hands
I could strike a match that sets the world on fire
Hold a grain of sand till it turns into a diamond
I could plant the seed, I could flip that switch, 
Make the sign of peace, I could make a fist
Oh, we could make this hurt or we could make it better
With these two hands I can tear down walls,
I can build a bridge, I can break my fall
With these two hands I can pray or fight
I can hold the torch, I can shine a light
With these two hands
Wipe the teardrops from your eyes
Reach up until we touch the sky
Free to dream and make it true
No, there ain't nothing we can't do
Oh, there ain't nothing we can't do
With these two hands I can tear down walls
I can build a bridge, I can break my fall
With these two hands I can pray or fight
I can hold the torch, I can shine a light
With these two hands
Wipe the teardrops from your eyes
Reach up until we touch the sky
Free to dream and make it true
No, there ain't nothing we can't do
Oh, there ain't nothing we can't do.
**Into The Echo
When it hurts just to talk, and it’s too dark to see
When my heart’s just a hole full of want, full of need
Stuck at a stoplight, hands gripping the wheel
Tears fill your eyes and you bleed just to feel
Someone beside you, someone to cry to
Into the echo, we shout our dreams
Into the echo, we throw our hearts
Into the echo, we send our love
Into the echo, to the echo, into the echo
To hear it back
Are you who you are
What’s under that mask
Do you burn for the future or yearn for the past
Did somebody send you, some broke fairy tale,
Now you wait by the water for a ship that has sailed
Into the echo, we shout our dreams
Into the echo, we throw our hearts
Into the echo, we send our love
Into the echo, to the echo, into the echo
Just to hear it back
When it hurts just to talk, and it’s too dark to see
You can touch, you can feel
Yeah, you just got to reach
Into the echo, we shout our dreams
Into the echo, we throw our hearts
Into the echo, we send our love
Into the echo, to the echo, into the echo
To hear it back
**Not Running Anymore
Bless me father I have sinned, 
I'm not sure where to begin. 
I won't name names or where I've been, 
But I've been there and back again. 
No Hail Mary's will save me, 
You learned to live with memories, 
Here, slip this sinner up your sleeve, 
Just stay inside until I leave. 
I've been running, always running 
Never have both feet on the floor. 
I've been running, always running, 
Now I'm not running any more... 
The hands of time may tick no more 
Let darkness fall upon this door 
No waves will wash up on this shore 
I won the fight but lost the war. 
I've been running, always running 
Never had both feet on the floor 
And I've been running, always running 
Now I ain't running anymore. 
There were roses I have loved 
Who've given or have given up 
I pushed your patience and my luck 
It wasn't love I didn't trust 
It wasn't you, or me, or us 
You've shouldered if's, and and's, and but's 
It's that way OK, I've said too much 
But I've been running, always running 
Never had both feet on the floor 
I've been running, always running 
Now I ain't running anymore.
**Old Habits Die Hard
You look like shit so dear my brother
I missed you too, yeah you dumb stupid mother
Jeep, welcome home sign, a bottle of red
At least you got freedom in an open out there
Free cheers till the best of the rest we got left
If you could dream anything, what would that be?
If you could dream back, would you share it with me?
We carry our choices, we hide our regrets
We know there's a price, we'll both pay our debts
But maybe they ain't seen the last of us yet
'Cause old habits die hard
Old habits die hard
It might be painful to smile
But it covers the scars
And old habits die hard
There's a face in the mirror, but it don't look like me
Yesterday's gone, a rain drop in the sea
I have your back for each day that's gone by
And I'll still have it till the day that I die
Yeah, I'll still have it till the day that I die
Old habits die hard
Old habits die hard
It might be painful to smile
But it covers the scars
And old habits die hard
Some day you'll be missed by those you leave behind
And I hope you touched other lives like you've touched mine
Old habits die hard
Old habits die hard
It might be painful to smile
But it covers the scars
Appearances change but don't change who we are
And old habits die hard.
**Every Road Leads Home To You
I got your picture on my phone
Your voice in my head
I'm lying here alone
Restless in some faraway bed
The stars will falling down
And I'm half a world away
I'm just trying to close the distance
To feel each breath you take
When the bridge is burning
And I'm loosing my faith
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth
Like a wild arrow flying
And I'm blindly running
From everything I thought I knew
And every road leads home to you,
Home to you
So you got me to believe
Made me turn on a dime
The writing on the wall
Right in front of me
Every song, every rhyme
But I don't need a thousand words
I need you save in my arms
I'll be standing strong
I'll keep holding on
When life tries tearing us apart
When the bridge is burning
And I'm loosing my faith
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth
Like a wild arrow flying
And I'm blindly running
From everything I thought I knew
No I ain't regretting
Just how lost I'm getting
Or the red lights I've been blowing through
My foot will find the pedal
As I'm counting the lines
Every road leads home to you
Every road leads home to you
Home,
Roads still leads me home to you
Sometimes I don't see the signs
The Headlights make me blind
The Roads still leads me home to you
When the bridge is burning
And I'm loosing my faith
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth
Like a wild arrow flying
And I'm blindly running
Everything I thought I knew
No I ain't regretting
Just how lost I'm getting
Or the red lights I've been blowing through
My foot will find the pedal
As I'm counting the lines
Every road leads home to you
Every road leads home to you
Home to you
Home to you
Home to you
Every road leads home to you
Home to you
Every road
Leads home to you
Every road leads home to you.
**A Teardrop To The Sea
So this is it
Here it is
A pot of gold
A Judas kiss
I got what I wanted
I paid every cost
I'd give it all back
To get back what I've lost
Like a wave on the beach
Last leaf on the tree
It's all just a memory
Love pick me up
I'm down on my knees
My treasure just rags
Wings that don't fly
I ain't praying, I'm choking
I'll fix what's been broken
Got nothing to hide
No time for goodbye
Nobody grieves
A teardrop to the sea
They shake my hand
Pat my back
They know my drink
Welcome back
The life of the party
Tears of a clown
Can't hear a heartbreak
The music's too loud
Love pick me up
I'm down on my knees
My treasure just rags
Wings that don't fly
I ain't praying, I'm choking
I fix what's been broken
Got nothing to hide
No time for goodbye
Nobody grieves
A teardrop to the sea
It's just broken glass
Chalk lines on the scene
Move along, move along
Ain't nothing here to see
Oh, love pick me up
I'm down on my knees
My riches just rags
Wings that don't fly
I ain't praying, I'm choking
I fix what's been broken
Got nothing to hide
No bitter goodbyes
Oh, love pick me up
Oh, love pick me up
Nobody grieves
A teardrop to the sea
A teardrop to the sea
A teardrop to the sea
**We Don't Run
Take a look around you, yeah, the sky is falling
Sinners say your prayers this train is off the tracks
Nothing is forever when tomorrow's calling
Dancing with the devil to get one day back
I'm not afraid of burning bridges
'Cause I know they're gonna light my way
Like a Phoenix, from the ashes
Welcome to the future it's a new day
We don't run
I'm standing my ground
We don't run
And we don't back down
There's fire in the sky
There's thunder on the mountains
Bless each tear and this dirt I was born in, (run)
We don't run
We don't run
Take me to the banks of your muddy water
Where the flesh and blood and the spirit meet
Only takes your touch for me to find salvation
You're the only reason that I still believe
I'm not afraid of burning bridges
'Cause I know they're gonna light my way
Like a Phoenix, from the ashes 
Welcome to the future it's a new day
We don't run
I'm standing my ground
We don't run
And we don't back down
There's fire in the sky
There's thunder on the mountain
Bless each tear and this dirt I was born in, (run)
We don't run
We don't run
We don't run
I'm standing my ground
We don't run
And we don't back down
There's fire in the sky
There's thunder on the mountain
Bless each tear and this dirt I was born in, (run)
We don't run
We don't run
**Saturday Night Gave Me Sunday Morning
I was living my life like a long-lost weekend
Never felt nothing, jumping right into the deep end
I wasn't missing nothing, that was ever worth getting
Never hung around enough to regret it
You came walking in late but just in time
You ended my excuses with a ten cent rhyme
Your shoes and attitude were stacked way up high
I knew right then you were the story of my life
Oh! Saturday nights gave me Sunday mornings
Opened my eyes, now it's a new day dawning
Think I might have pushed my luck a time or two
Everything about us is what gets me through
I never thought I'd hear the church bells ringing
I never learned the song this heart was singing
No regrets, I took that step, yeah I'm still falling
Saturday nights gave me Sunday morning, yeah
When you're driving down a street that's only going one way
When every day starts feeling like a month of Mondays
You should know I still got something left to prove
I know what it takes to get back to you
Oh! Saturday nights gave me Sunday mornings
Opened my eyes, now it's a new day dawning
Think I might have pushed my luck a time or two
Everything about us is what gets me through
I never thought I'd hear the church bells ringing
I never learned the song this heart was singing
No regrets, I took that step, yeah I'm still falling
Saturday nights gave me Sunday morning, yeah
Remember those nights staring out at the lights
Making time with our feet in the sand
Making up words to our favorite songs
Laughing loud with those drinks in our hands
And as that boy put his head on her shoulder
She pulled him tight to get a bit closer
And as the world just disappeared
You whispered in my ear
Oh! Saturday nights gave me Sunday mornings
Opened my eyes, now it's a new day dawning
Think I might have pushed my luck a time or two
Everything about us is what gets me through
I never thought I'd hear the church bells ringing
I never learned the song this heart was singing
No regrets, I took that step, yeah I'm still falling
Saturday nights gave me Sunday morning, yeah
Sunday mornings
**We All Fall Down
Don't be afraid to lose your way
Take that step don't hesitate
Your time is now
Don't be afraid to scrape your knees
On these streets of shattered dreams
Stand up and be proud
I'm telling you now
Climb every mountain
How high doesn't matter
Don't ever be afraid to fall
Walk out on that wire
Climb every ladder
Keep your back against the wall
And don't be scared to hit the ground
'Cause we all fall down
Down on your luck you're feeling small
The little things seem 10 feet tall
Watch your dreams fall apart at the seams
You want to scream and shout out loud
When you sit up they knock you down
You're a long way from home
But you're never alone, yeah
Climb every mountain
How high doesn't matter
Don't ever be afraid to fall
Walk out on that wire
Climb every ladder
Keep your back against the wall
And don't be scared to hit the ground
'Cause we all fall
We're all digging in this dirt
We're all living hand to mouth
We're all trying to fit in
Trying not to chicken out
Life doesn't wait, don't hesitate
Don't lose your faith it's judgement day
They're calling you out
I'm calling you now
Climb every mountain
How high doesn't matter
Don't ever be afraid to fall
Walk out on that wire
Climb every ladder
Keep your back against the wall
And don't be scared to hit the ground
'Cause we all fall down
'Cause we all fall down
'Cause we all fall down
**Blind Love
Welcome to another hard night
You made it through another day
Sit at the counter counting tips
Can't count on nothing else these days
Don't want to go home to the T.V.
Don't want to go down to some bar
You grab a blanket,
Put the top down
And go driving in your car
Though your bed's as warm as January
On this cold December's night
Close your eyes love
Sleep safe and sound tonight
Cause blind love
Is guiding every step I take
It's one less I got to make
Till I find my way home try love
Welcome to another morning
The sun's still shining, but it's grey
Get out of bed now sleepy head
You'd give an arm to hear him say
Oh, and no one said that it'd be easy
But no one said it'd be this hard
To close your eyes love
Sleep safe and sound tonight
Cause blind love
Is guiding every step I take
It's one less I got to make
Till I find my way home try love
If there's an patron saint of blind love
I hope he keeps me on your mind, love
With every moment I'm away
We're getting closer to the day
We'll never have to say goodbye, love
These days it's hard for me
To feel the sand beneath my feet
With this gunny sack and boots on
Oh, but no one said this would be easy
And no one said it'd be this hard
Close your eyes love
Sleep safe and sound tonight
Cause blind love
Is guiding every step I take
It's one less I got to make
Till I find my way home try love
If there's an patron saint of blind love
I pray he keeps me on your mind, love
With every moment I'm away
We're getting closer to the day
We'll never have to say goodbye, love
With our blind love
Blind love
Welcome to another hard night
You made it through another day
**Who Would You Die For
When you walked into the party
The guests all disappeared
You dropped in with a group of friends,
I didn't notice they were there
Was it the way your fingers held that glass,
The way your lips broke when you laughed
I don't care if the devil's keeping score,
For just one look I'd crawl across the floor
Who would you die for
Who would you die for
Will you write me lipstick letters
And miss me when I'm gone
Wake up tangled in the sheets
Still aching for my arms
The way you move its almost holy,
Hoping you don't know you own me
All I want is all of you and more.
The big bad wolf is knocking at your door
Who would you die for
Who would you die for
I want to know your secrets and your sins
I want to feel you breathing out and in
I want to know, I want to know
Who would you die for
Who would you die for
I want to know what makes you feel
I want to know love truly heals
[x4]

**Fingerprints
I gave you my fingerprints
Left them all over you
Tangled up in your sheets
This heartache's the only proof
I gave you my fingerprints
Now just like you they're gone
The man invisible
I'll be him from now on
The last time that I saw them
They were running through your hair
You held one between your lips
And brought another there
The last time that I saw them
I haven't seen them since
No matter who or what I touch
I leave no evidence
I gave you my fingerprints
I said I'd give you everything
But who thought you'd take it all
Does a promise really break
If nobody sees it fall
A hard rain can't wash away
The taste of your memory
Don't know what I would do
If you should stop haunting me
The last time that I saw them
They were running through your hair
You held one between your lips
And brought another there
The last time that I saw them
Unbuttoning your dress
Those pretty pictures in my head
Are the only thing you left
I gave you my fingerprints
That shiny box I gave to you
Was all there was to me
All it was to you was just a faded memory
I gave her my fingerprints
Guilty or innocent
I have to ask myself
Would I do it all again
Would I
The last time that I saw them
They were running through your hair
You held one between your lips
And brought another there
The last time that I saw them
I haven't seen them since
No matter who or what I touch
I leave no evidence
I gave you my finger prints
**Life Is Beautiful
Try to walk on water
You'll sink just like a stone
Said you'd get home early
But you always stay too long
You got all the answers, but the answers are all wrong
I can't save me from my sins
Innocence my long lost friend
No wind no rain can wash away
These hallowed words my mouth won't pray
You fly you fall
Life is beautiful
She's there to lift me up
But I only let her down
A guilty king
Wears a broken crown
She's sweet forgiveness
In a lonesome lost and found
I can't save me from my sins
Innocence my long lost friend
No wind no rain can wash away
These hallowed words my mouth won't pray
You fly you fall
Life is beautiful
New gets old
The night gets cold
The sad goodbye
Life is beautiful
The sky is cracked
We can't go back
Dry your eyes
Life is beautiful
I can't save me from my sins
Innocence my long lost friend
No wind no rain can wash away
These hallowed words my mouth won't pray
New gets old
The night get cold
The sad goodbye
Life is beautiful
The sky is cracked
We can't go back
Dry your eyes
Life is beautiful
Life is beautiful
**I'm Your Man
When your heart is hungry
When you want a secret you can keep
You know that you can call me
Anytime for anything you need
No one asking questions
No need for alibis
No need for wasting words
I'm who I am
I'm your man
No job that I can't handle
There ain't much that I ain't done
I'll be that one call that you get
When you can't call no one
When the room is dark and empty
There's no need to explain
Baby I'll come running, here I am
I'm your man
We know not to ask questions
So no one has to lie
We both know without hello
There won't be no goodbyes
No promises that we won't keep
No more to understand
Tonight you're my woman and I'm your man
I'm your man
We both know we're lonely
When we hold each other tight
But we won't ask forgiveness
When we walk away at night
No one asking questions
No need for alibis
No need to say those words
Just take my hand
I'm your man
**Burning Bridges
Sayonara
Adios, auf wiedersehen, farewell,
Adieu, good night, guten abend,
Here's one last song you can sell
Lets call it burning bridges
It's a sing along as well
Ciao, adieu, good nacht, guten abend
Play it for your friends in hell
Someone shut the lights off
Turn the page
The stories I could write
I've seen a million faces
And I've lived a couple lives
Here's our history for all to see
The smiles and all the scars
First the rising then the falling
Call this chapter shooting stars
That must sound good from where you are
Sayonara
Adios, auf wiedersehen, farewell,
Adieu, good night, guten abend,
Here's one last song you can sell
Let's call it burning bridges
It's a sing along as well
Ciao, adieu, good nacht, guten abend
Play it for your friends in hell
Check the box
Mark this day
There's nothing more to say
After 30 years of loyalty
They let you dig the grave
Now maybe you could learn to sing
Or even strum along
I'll give you half the publishing
You're why I wrote this song
Everybody sing along
Sayonara
Adios, auf wiedersehen, farewell,
Adieu, good night, guten abend,
Here's one last song you can sell
Lets call it burning bridges
It's a sing along as well
Hope my money and my masters
Buy a front row seat in hell
Ciao, adieu, good nacht, guten abend
Play this for your friends in st. tropez
**Take Back The Night
These seven days and nights
Are always blending
This so called tragic life
So where's that happy ending
Stuck at the traffic light
It's just the same old song
I'm humming all the words
But I won't sing along
Listen
I need something different
I'm tired of giving in
Time to start living
We're going to take back the night
Surrender to me and save my life
Let's start a fire, let's start a fight
We're going to take back the night
Do you want to be
Another casualty
The one who stands his ground
When everybody leaves
It's time for taking sides
It's time to face the truth
Too late for turning back
So whatcha going to do
Listen
I need something different
There's no time for reason
I'm tired of bleeding
We're going to take back the night
Surrender to me and save my life
Let's start a fire, let's start a fight
We're going to take back the night
Listen
I need something different
I'm tired of dreaming
This time I'm screaming
We're going to take back the night
Surrender to me and save my life
Let's start a fire, let's start a fight
We're going to take back the night
Take back the night
We're going to take back the night
**This House Is Not For Sale
These four walls have got a story to tell
The door is off the hinges, there's no wish in the well
Outside the sky is coal black, the streets are on fire
The picture windows cracked and there's no where to run
I know, I know
This house is not for sale
I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home
I'm coming home
Drove a spike into the ground and I staked my claim
Standing on the dirt where they'll dig my grave
Now what built these walls is in my veins
No time for looking back, the wolf is at the door
This heart, this soul
This house is not for sale
I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home
I'm coming home
This house was built on trust
That's what it is and always was
No wrecking ball could knock it down
This house was built on higher ground
I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home
I'm coming home
Coming home
I'm coming home
This house is not for sale
Coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
This house is not for sale
**Living With The Ghost
Marry me to the blue sky
Bury me in that long last drop of hard rain
Meet me where they stop time
That's you to me on the shovel that's digging this grave
Till I can waltz on a moonbeam
Till I can find a way to turn all tears into wine
I'll hitch my ride to a day dream
Can't unkiss the lips that love is leaving behind
I ain't living with the ghost
No future living in the past
I've seen what hate has done to hope
Tomorrow wasn't built to last
I ain't living with the ghost
How can I scream, I'm scared to breathe
I wrote each word, you gave the toast
But we were fire and gasoline
I ain't living with the ghost
I set my sails over wheat fields
Rode waves of amber, let a new sun shine on my face
I dropped the sword, put down my shield
I left your scars for the stars, guiding my way
I traded hurting for healing
I must admit that I was reeling
Now I'm feeling just fine
Traded nightmares for dreaming
Go tell your shadows that I got out alive
I ain't living with the ghost
No future living in the past
I've seen what hurt has done to hope
I found the tree I cut the rope
Tomorrow wasn't built to last
I ain't living with the ghost
How can I scream, I'm scared to breathe
I wrote each word, you gave the toast
But we were fire and gasoline
I ain't living with the ghost
Last night I had this dream
I saw a man wash his feet
In the church holy water
He worked up to his knees
From his arms to his neck
Said I'm in over my head
He was crying trying to get some relief
Lord, I'm just trying to get some relief
I had this dream
That man was me
I ain't living with the ghost
No future living in the past
I've seen what hurt has done to hope
I found the tree I cut the rope
Tomorrow wasn't built to last
I ain't living with the ghost
How can I scream, I'm scared to breathe
I wrote each word, you gave the toast
But we were fire and gasoline
Now I ain't living with the ghost
**Knockout
Everyday I wake up with my back against the wall
Anytime you get up someone wants to see you fall
If you're afraid to lose it all, you're never gonna win
I'll be giving you the finger
Sticking out my chin
Boom, boom, boom
Here comes the boom, boom, boom
Here comes the knockout
My time is right now
Turning your lights out
I'm throwing down
Here comes the knockout
Until the last round
I'm throwing down
Go start a fire, go start a fight
No regrets, this is your life
Here comes the knockout
My time is right now
I'm throwing down
Are you living in a nightmare
Are you living in a dream?
Do you stand for something
Will you fall for anything
It's easier to count me out but you can count me in
Cause I'm giving you the finger
Sticking out my chin
Boom, boom, boom
Here comes the boom, boom, boom
Here comes the knockout
My time is right now
Turning your lights out
I'm throwing down
Here comes the knockout
Until the last round
I'm throwing down
Go start a fire, go start a fight
No regrets, this is your life
Here comes the knockout
My time is right now
I'm throwing down, down, down
Down, down
Throwing down, down, down
Down, down
Did you really live your life
Or did it pass you by?
What's it take to tell yourself
You really were alive
Look me in the eye
Here comes the knockout
My time is right now
Turning your lights out
I'm throwing down
Here comes the knockout
Until the last round
I'm throwing down
Go start a fire, go start a fight
No regrets, this is your life
Here comes the knockout
My time is right now
I'm throwing down
**Labor Of Love
Smoke stack blowing, there's a fire in the sky
Fahrenheit rising, oh, higher than high
Pressure's building up, sparks are gonna fly
I know where this is going when I look into your eyes
I know where this is going when I look into your eyes
Sweet sweat's rolling down the middle of your spine
Bodies move together, perfect rhythm and time
Baby say my name, I'll write yours in the sky
Higher than a rocket on the fourth of July
Higher than a rocket on the fourth of July
It's good, it's good, it's good to be alive
Its a full time job, the work's never done
Twenty-four seven, it's a labor of love
Yeah, everything I got, it's all about us
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
Only fools count treasure in silver and gold
I don't want for nothing that these hands can hold
If you need something done, put it on the list
And if I need some sugar, I'll get it from your lips
If I need some sugar, I'll get it from your lips
It's good, it's good, it's good to be alive
Its a full time job, the work's never done
Twenty-four seven, it's a labor of love
Yeah, everything I got, it's all about us
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
One taste of your lips, every night, every day
I know every curve, but it's never the same
If love is a fire, I'll go down in those flames
I wanna die in your arms, hearing you say my name
I wanna die in your arms, hearing you say my name
I wanna die in your arms, hearing you say my name
Its a full time job, the work's never done
Twenty-four seven, it's a labor of love
Yeah, everything I got, it's all about us
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
Its a full time job, the work's never done
Twenty-four seven, it's a labor of love
Give everything I've got, I can't get enough
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
**Born Again Tomorrow
If you were born again tomorrow
This ain't a test, no it's a warning
Ain't gonna say the sky is falling
You got to read between the lines
Stop waiting for a sign
Who's gonna live your life
Yeah you don't have to look back to see where we are
The future's looking brighter than a hand full of stars
You got to hold on, hold on
Be strong
If you were born again tomorrow
Would you live your life like yesterday
If you were born again tomorrow
I wouldn't live my life any other way
Don't have to end up where you started
Heaven loves the broken hearted
You learn from your mistakes
Bones grow stronger where they break
Who says that scars don't fade
Yeah you don't have to look back to see where we are
The future's looking brighter than a hand full of stars
You got to hold on, hold on
You gotta be strong
If you were born again tomorrow
Would you live your life like yesterday
If you were born again tomorrow
I wouldn't live my life any other way
Would you relive every moment
Would you tear out any page
If you were born again tomorrow
I wouldn't live my life any other way
Any other way ey, ey, ey
Any other way ey
If you were born again tomorrow
Would you live your life like yesterday
If you were born again tomorrow
I wouldn't live my life any other way
Would you relive every moment
Would you tear out any page
If you were born again tomorrow
I wouldn't live my life any other way
Any other way
Born again tomorrow
If you were born again tomorrow
Born again tomorrow
**Roller Coaster
I see you thinking twice
Wish I could read your mind
Move up or out of line
Too late for praying
I know we might lose our breath
We might be scared to death
This chance is like a step
Just got to take it
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Countdown to here we go oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hold on tight, slide a little closer
Up so high stars are on our shoulders
Time flies by, don't close your eyes
Kiss by kiss love is like a thrill ride
What goes up might take us upside down
Life ain't a merry go round
It's a roller coaster
It's a roller coaster
Can't lie and won't pretend
I know what's round the bend
Too late to start again
Won't take it slower
Let's slip right off these tracks
We'll fly or we might crash
Don't look down, don't look back
Cause it ain't over
Hold on tight, slide a little closer
Up so high stars are on our shoulders
Time flies by, don't close your eyes
Kiss by kiss love is like a thrill ride
What goes up might take us upside down
Life ain't a merry go round
It's a roller coaster
It's a roller coaster
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Countdown to here we go oh oh oh oh oh oh
So hold on tight, slide a little closer
Up so high stars are on our shoulders
It's a roller coaster
Kiss by kiss love is like a thrill ride
What goes up might take us upside down
Life ain't a merry go round
It's a roller coaster
It's a roller coaster
Roller coaster
It's a roller coaster
**New Year's Day
The midnight bells are ringing
A ship is setting sail
A newborn baby's crying
As lovers say farewell
I'm singing hallelujah
Amen, the angels say
Let's hope tomorrow finds us
It's new year's day
Let's toast to new beginnings, okay
Raise up a glass and say
For all of our tomorrows
And what was yesterday
I'm singing carpe diem
I'm saying seize the day
Come on, let's live forever
It's new year's day
Where does the time go
Just watch the wind blow
Sha la la la
It's new year's day
Green does the grass grow
Outside my window
Sha la la la
It's new year's day
This message in a bottle
The wisdom of the wine
It's just a rainy Monday
This isn't Auld Lang Syne
I'm singing hallelujah
Amen, the angels say
Let's hope tomorrow finds us
It's new year's day
**The Devil's In The Temple
This was a church
A house full of prayer
It ain't that now
I could tear it down
There's thieves at the altar
A snake wears the crown
Handing you coal
Swearing it's gold
Look what they've done to this house of love
It's too late to turn river to blood
The saviors come and gone, we're all out of time
The devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine
I'd turn things around
I would if I could
Crash through the gates
Break every chain
Jail for the jailers
Sing freedoms song
Amazing grace
Burn down this place
Look what they've done to this house of love
It's too late to turn river to blood
The saviors come and gone, we're all out of time
The devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine
Look what they've done to this house of love
Look what they've done to this house of love
The devil's in the temple and he's making a mess
Got the Mona Lisa, got his hands up her dress
The gun is in his hand but he ain't gonna confess
He lies
Look what they've done to this house of love
It's too late to turn river to blood
The saviors come and gone, we're all out of time
The devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine
The devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine
The devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine
**Scars On This Guitar
Another Friday night I'm somewhere
A little drunk and worn out from the show
It's a hallway to a hotel room
The truck's already rolling down the road
I find the lights take off my coat
I see her there just lying on the bed
She's seen me through my yesterdays
God knows tonight I'm needing her again
She's the place I go
When there's nowhere left to run to
She's the one I hold
When there's no one to hold on to
She's been with me late at night
When I was drowning in the dark
She heard my every word
When I was pouring out my heart
So I thank my lucky stars
For every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar
She's given me her best
When I am at my worst
When I can't find the pieces
Fingers scratching in the dirt
She offers no forgiveness
Cause she likes to make it hurt
She's the place I go
When there's nowhere left to run to
She's the one I hold
When there's no one to hold on to
She's been with me late at night
When I was drowning in the dark
She heard my every word
When I was pouring out my heart
So I thank my lucky stars
For every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar
Morning like a freight train
Last night still ringing in my head
Before today becomes tomorrow
Tonight I know I'll do it all again
She's the place I go
When there's nowhere left to run to
She's the one I hold
When there's no one to hold on to
She's been with me late at night
When I was drowning in the dark
She heard my every word
When I was pouring out my heart
So I thank my lucky stars
For every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar
And so I thank my lucky stars
For every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar
**God Bless This Mess
I got some blood under my nails, I got some mud on my face
My voice is shot I'm going grey, these muscles all ache
Don't cry for me, I'm the life of the party
I'm smiling most of the time
I may be gritting my teeth, can't get back where we started
These days I'm doing just fine
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
Won't pound my chest or criticize
I must confess, I've lived, I've died
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
I knew every buried body paid for each head stone
I may have led the prayers in public but I cried alone
Found God through sin but this ain't my confession
I'll wait on judgement day
It's lose or win, got no need for protection
Stand up or out of my way
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
Won't pound my chest or criticize
I must confess, I've lived, I've died
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
The howling dooms day dogs
Are snapping at your feet
Round here the sky is cracked
But won't admit defeat
Down here there they got your back
And still they're at your side
This treasure chest of rags
Still keeps this dream alive
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
Won't pound my chest or criticize
I must confess, I've lived, I've died
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
**Reunion
This isn't how the story ends, my friends,
It's just a fork along the road
Don't say your prayers, save your amens,
You've come this far, but you're still far from home
Don't say goodbye, just say farewell
Write every line you'll live to tell
Hold your head high like Harry give 'em hell
As the night ignites the day
Make some memories along the way
Write your song, sing along, love your life
Learn to laugh, dare to dance, touch the sky
Take pictures each step of the way
Make this the best of the rest of your days
Start your revolution
And I'll see you at the reunion
Some friends will go and some will stay,
Okay, some last a chapter, some a page
For some love comes disguised as lust
But you'll find love when you find trust one day
Do better than our parents did
Imperfect husband, wife and kids
Go chart your course then turn it upside down
Go live your life eyes open wide
Who's to say what's wrong or right
Right?
Write your song, sing along, love your life
Learn to laugh, dare to dance, touch the sky
Take pictures each step of the way
Make this the best of the rest of your days
Start your revolution
And I'll see you at the reunion
Oh-oh
As the night ignites the day
Go make some memories along the way
Write your song, sing along, love your life
Yeah, learn to laugh, dare to dance, touch the sky
Take pictures each step of the way
Make this the best of the rest of your days
I say, go start your own revolution
And I'll see you at the reunion
I'll see you at the reunion
Oh, I'll see you at the reunion
This isn't how the story ends, my friends,
It's just a fork along the road
**Come On Up To Our House
Come on up to our house
Let us make you feel at home
Come on up to our house
I will leave the porch light...
I wish tonight would last forever
And it would never end
We were introduced as strangers
Now we're leaving here as friends
Every word that you speak is a melody
As we're writing the songs of our lives
Everyone knows we don't want to go home
But we can't stay here tonight
Come on up to our house
Let us make you feel at home
Come on up to our house
I will leave the porch light on
All are welcome at our table
You could never stay too long
Come on up to out house
I will leave the porch light on
You could tell me your life story
I could finish every line
The one about hurt and the heartache
It still gets me every time
Every word that you speak is the harmony
To the song that I'm singing inside
Everyone knows we don't want to go home
But we can't stay here tonight
Come on up to our house
Let us make you feel at home
Come on up to our house
I will leave the porch light on
All are welcome at our table
You could never stay too long
Come on up to our house
I will leave the porch light on
I wish tonight could last forever
Cause I ain't good at saying goodbye
Everyone knows we don't want to go home
But we can't stay here tonight
Come on up to our house
Let us make you feel at home
Come on up to our house
I will leave the porch light on
For the restless and the weary
You will never be alone
All are welcome at our table
You could never stay too long
So come on up to our house
I will leave the porch light on
Come on up to our house
Let us make you feel at home
(Come on up to our house)
Come on up to our house
I will leave the porch light on
(Come on up to our house)
Come on up to our house
Let us make you feel at home
(Come on up to our house)
Come on up to our house
**Real Love
They're putting up the chairs to close, she let me settle up my tab
I told her button up it's cold, I ain't too drunk to hail us a cab
We can get a cup of coffee but unless you gotta get back home…
Sitting across that table, a gypsy couldn't read her mind
I took her hand and told her I just wanna crawl into her eyes
She shook her head and said, "It's cruel"; cool is just a cheap disguise
Have you ever known a real love?
The kind of love that makes you feel, love?
No, this ain't let's make a deal, love
Make an angel give his wings up
It makes you guilty 'cause you want more
If it's a kiss that you would die for
Feels like you're falling through the stars
If it can break your heart
It's real love
We drank that muddy pot of coffee; it was morning when I walked her home
I've never been this lonely, lying in this bed alone
Her words still ringing in my head, her sad eyes sunk me like a stone
Have you ever known a real love?
The kind of love that makes you feel, love?
No, this ain't let's make a deal, love
Make an angel give his wings up
It makes you guilty 'cause you want more
If it's a kiss that you would die for
Feels like you're falling through the stars
If it can break your heart
It's real love
I put on the same shirt, and I ran out the door
Stole a fistful of roses from the sidewalk store
Just my heart in my hand I had nothing to throw
Standing up on her front step calling to your window…
Have you ever known a real love?
The kind of love that makes you feel, love?
No, this ain't let's make a deal, love
Make an angel give his wings up
It makes you guilty 'cause you want more
If it's a kiss that you will die for
Feels like you're falling through the stars
If it can break your heart
It's real love
Feels like you're falling through the stars
If it can break your heart
It's real love
**All Hail The King
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
All the people came to hear him speak from miles around
They hung on every word a song in every sound
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
He touched the sky to light up all the stars
He could snap his fingers and catch lightning in a jar
I am you and you are me and we are who we are
Touch the sky and light up all the stars
All hail the king whose castle's falling down
The paper prince who wears a cardboard crown
Poor man has his money, rich man has his gold
All hail the king whose fortune is his soul
He climbed the clouds to heaven's highest hill
When you get that high the earth below looks just like a blue pill
Gave wind to all his horses and to all his men good will
When he climbed down from heaven's highest hill
All hail the king whose castle's falling down
The paper prince who wears a cardboard crown
Poor man has his money, rich man has his gold
All hail the king whose fortune is his soul
He breathed his last, they laid him in the ground
False prophets spoke of riches and said all hail to us now
The faithful wouldn't listen and they never would bow down
He breathed his last, they laid him in the ground
All hail the king whose castle's falling down
The paper prince who wears a cardboard crown
Poor man has his money, rich man has his gold
All hail the king whose fortune is his soul
**I Will Drive You Home
Here comes the next big thing
There's a new gun in town
There'll be a faster one
Before the sun goes down
They've come to kick the tires
They'd like to take a spin
See how it takes the turns
See if it breaks or bends
But I will drive you home
I want you to know that
I will drive you home
Hell, it ain't nothing new
Everything new gets old
Maybe some glitter's gon
But we're still good as gold
When some driver comes
And tries to jump the start
Thinks he can steal your love
Hot wire your heart
But I (I) will drive (drive) you home (home)
I want you to know that
I (I) will drive (drive) you home (home)
Let 'em rev their engines
Let 'em spin their wheels
All they've got is shine
They're just chrome and steel
But I (I) will drive (drive) you home (home)
Here comes that faster fast
Here comes that higher high
As we walk on pas
They just step aside
I (I) will drive (drive) you home (home)
I want you to know that
I (I) will drive (drive) you home (home)
Let 'em rev their engines
Let 'em spin their wheels
All they got is shine
They're just chrome and steel
When they raise the flag
And the smoke has cleared
When the rest are gone
I'll be standing here
I (I) will drive (drive) you home (home)
I want you to know that
I (I) will drive (drive) you home (home)
Let 'em rev their engines
Let 'em spin their wheels
All they got is shine
They're just chrome and steel
When they raise the flag
And the smoke has cleared
When the rest are gone
I'll be standing here
Let 'em rev their engines
Let 'em spin their wheels
All they got is shine
They're just chrome and steel
When they raise the flag
And the smoke has cleared
When the rest are gone
I'll be standing here
**Goodnight New York
Morning comes crashing like a rock through a window
Jackhammer banging on the hot concrete
Take your stand (hey!)
Move it, man!
It's a backtalk, sidewalk symphony
Uber cars, yellow cabs, thick as smoke
Painted girls and meter maids will leave you broke
Sax man blowing shootin' through my veins
There's a rhythm to the rocket that's intoxicating
Goodnight New York goodnight
Don't ever close your eyes
If these streets could talk, New York, New York
So fine they named you twice
Your face, your brains
No other place
From east to west, these streets are blessed
Goodnight New York 
Sleep tight New York
Goodnight
Starbucks, FedEx trucks on every street and avenue
Broadway lights, shining bright, make everybody beautiful
Walking on the high line, reaching for the sky line
If Alexander Hamilton could see it all
Garbage trucks backing up
Beep, beep, beep
Dogs barking on the balcony
The kids can't sleep
Scaffolds, pot holes, bagman's on a bicycle
Fast trains, bus, planes
Welcome to the carnival
Goodnight New York goodnight
Don't ever close your eyes
If these streets could talk, New York, New York
So fine they named you twice
Your face, your brains
No other place
From east to west, these streets are blessed
Goodnight New York 
Sleep tight New York
Goodnight
The bravest and the finest
My hand's on my heart for you
To the ones who paid the price
And to those who saw us through
It's late, I'm gettin' weary
So, for now, I'll say
Goodnight New York goodnight
Don't ever close your eyes
If these streets could talk, New York, New York
So fine they named you twice
Goodnight New York goodnight
Don't ever close your eyes
If these streets could talk, New York, New York
So fine they named you twice
Your face, your brains
No other place
From east to west, these streets are blessed
Goodnight New York 
Sleep tight New York
Goodnight
Ah, goodnight, New York
Sleep tight, New York
Goodnight
So goodnight, New York
Sleep tight, New York
Goodnight
